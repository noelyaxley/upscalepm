### H1: About Upscale Project Management

### H2: Design-Led. Delivery-Focused. Purpose-Driven Project Management for Complex Builds

### Our Story
"Upscale began with a vision: to bridge the gap between thoughtful design and effective delivery. Noel Yaxley's early career as a designer at award-winning architecture firm FJMT gave him deep insight into how buildings function, particularly in tertiary education and laboratory environments. That foundation evolved into a focus on project management, where Noel led delivery on some of New South Wales' most dynamic developments through roles at Root Partnerships, Property NSW, and Sydney Water."

### Specialisations
"Upscale specialises in managing technically demanding projects where stakeholder coordination, regulatory navigation, and design integrity are essential. From specialist laboratory infrastructure to public sector workplaces, heritage hospitality venues to modular emergency services facilities, we offer a steady, experienced hand to guide projects from conception through to completion."

### Comprehensive Services
"We provide comprehensive project leadership across all phases of development. This includes early feasibility analysis, design brief development, consultant coordination, planning and approval processes, tendering, construction oversight, and final handover. Our expertise also extends to workplace strategy, building upgrades, and complex fit-outs—often delivered within occupied sites or constrained urban environments."

### Unique Expertise
"Our portfolio includes more than $40 million in specialist infrastructure and facilities, including large-scale laboratories for Sydney Water, significant school infrastructure upgrades, student accommodation initiatives, and high-density residential and hospitality developments. We also bring experience in managing regional ambulance station programs, remote office refurbishments, and rezoning proposals to unlock development opportunities."

### Value Proposition
"Upscale Project Management delivers fresh thinking and precision across every stage of your project"

### Client-Centric Approach
"At Upscale, we believe successful project delivery hinges on listening first. Every client has unique drivers—whether it's operational efficiency, user experience, financial performance, or long-term flexibility. We tailor our process to suit each client's needs, providing honest advice, transparent communication, and structured decision-making that supports their goals. Our role is not just to manage timelines and contracts, but to guide our clients through the full lifecycle of a project with confidence and clarity."

### Our Philosophy

**Meta Description:** "Granville Diggers Club Development Preserving Heritage, Enhancing Community..."

### H1: Granville Diggers Club Development
### Subtitle: Preserving Heritage, Enhancing Community

### Body Content

"The Granville Diggers Club has been a valued part of Sydney's west since 1964, holding deep cultural and civic significance for the Granville community. Its site forms part of a broader heritage precinct that includes the Granville Memorial, commemorating the service and sacrifice of local residents. The club building itself — though adapted over time — is an important civic landmark, sitting at the intersection of memory, social life, and local identity."

"The club development is not simply a matter of refurbishment. It is a careful exercise in heritage-sensitive renewal — balancing respect for the original architectural form and its symbolic role in the community, while delivering the upgraded amenities and contemporary spaces that today's patrons expect."

"The design vision by GeriesPayne draws on the heritage report's recommendations, ensuring original facade elements, significant internal features, and the site's overall character are preserved or sympathetically adapted. At the same time, the project introduces new dining areas, a performance stage, a children's play space, and upgraded reception and bar facilities — transforming the club into a modern, multi-generational destination."

### Project Details
- **Type:** Club Development
- **Location:** Granville, NSW
- **Architect:** GeriesPayne

### Heritage and Community Value (H2)

- **Civic Significance:** The club has long been a social anchor for the district, hosting community gatherings, performances, and commemorative events.
- **Cultural Continuity:** The redevelopment protects and showcases its heritage character, ensuring that future generations can connect with the club's story.
- **Economic Sustainability:** By modernising facilities and broadening its appeal, the club strengthens its ability to attract members, host events, and generate revenue for ongoing upkeep and programming.
- **Design Sensitivity:** All works are guided by heritage principles, ensuring that new interventions complement, rather than overpower, the original building's fabric and form.

### Upscale Project Management's Role (H2)

"Noel was brought into the project at a pivotal stage, shortly after Development Application (DA) approval was secured. His role has been to work closely with the client organisation to:"

- "Firm up project scope in alignment with operational and strategic goals."
- "Facilitate communication between the club, architect, and consultants."
- "Ensure that heritage considerations remain central to all design and delivery decisions."

**Modified:** 2025-09-18

### H1: Crosslife Church Asquith Development
### H2: Client Side Project Management
### H3: Our Role: Client-Side Project Management

### Body Content

"At UpScale Project Management, we specialise in helping community organisations turn their visions into reality. One of our recent projects, CrossLife Church in Asquith, is a great example of how careful planning, contract administration, and client-side advocacy can guide a project smoothly from feasibility into construction."

"CrossLife Church had a clear goal: to upgrade and expand their facilities to create a welcoming, flexible, and accessible environment for worship, connection, and community events. Their existing building was well-loved, but it no longer met the needs of a growing and diverse congregation."

### Vision Statement
"The vision for the redevelopment included:"
- "A new welcoming foyer with a bay window and lofty ceiling that immediately communicates openness and hospitality."
- "A new worship space with improved audio-visual systems for sermons, music, and events."
- "An accessible toilet that ensures inclusivity for all members and visitors."
- "A new kitchen that supports community functions, gatherings, and hospitality."
- "A crying room that allows parents and carers with young children to stay connected to worship in comfort."

"This scope required not just good design, but also a carefully managed process that would allow the church to make informed decisions, control costs, and minimise risks."

### Project Details
- **Type:** Church
- **Location:** Asquith, NSW
- **Builder:** Radial Projects
- **Architect:** Chung Architects

### Services Provided
"As client-side project managers, UpScale PM acted as the independent representative of CrossLife Church throughout the early stages of the project. Our responsibilities included:"

- "Organising the PPR (Project Planning Report): This document set out the scope, budget, and timeline in clear terms, ensuring that all stakeholders were aligned before commitments were made."
- "Advising on contract selection: Most commercial projects in Sydney use the MBA BC3 contract, which we reviewed and tailored to suit the church's specific needs. We explained its key clauses — such as liquidated damages, delay costs, retention, and variations — so the church leadership understood exactly what they were signing."
- "Contract negotiation and administration: By preparing the contract and ensuring the builder's obligations were clearly set out, we reduced risk and positioned the client for a smoother construction phase."
- "Managing tender and appointment: [truncated]"
