## Architectural Design Meets Practical Construction Project Management

In parallel with leading major public infrastructure projects, Noel Yaxley has delivered selected private commissions through Yaxley Studio and Upscale Group. These commissions demonstrate his combined strengths in architectural design and expert **construction project management**, particularly in sensitive urban contexts.  Upscale Project Management provides [services](http://b2blistings.org) for boutique developments.

A recent project now lodged for Development Application (DA) at 92–94 Wolfe Street, The Hill, Newcastle, showcases this integrated approach. Situated within a heritage conservation area and mine subsidence district, the dual terrace alterations reflect a refined blend of conservation awareness and contemporary living aspirations.

## Redevelopment of Heritage Terraces: Wolfe Street, The Hill

The Wolfe Street residences are located within Newcastle's 'The Hill Heritage Conservation Area', an R3 Medium Density Residential zone. The site’s historical value, compact size, and heritage overlay presented a complex design and approval scenario.

The project involves alterations and additions to two existing three-storey rendered brick terraces, including a four-storey rear extension and rooftop dormers. Importantly, the street-facing facade remains largely intact, preserving the terrace's contribution to the streetscape.

## Key project facts:

- **Address:** 92 & 94 Wolfe Street, The Hill NSW 2300
- **FSR:** 2.2:1 (92 Wolfe) and 2.1:1 (94 Wolfe)
- **Height:** ~11m from Wolfe St, ~13m from rear natural ground level
- **Private open space:** ~54m2 total across balconies, courtyard, and rooftop terrace
- **Heritage status:** Within The Hill Heritage Conservation Area, not individually listed
- **Mine Subsidence:** Project to be reviewed by Mines Subsidence Board
- **Sustainability:** Stormwater managed via existing system, BASIX Certificate to be submitted

## Integrated Design for Light, Privacy and Contextual Fit

The proposed additions address longstanding limitations in natural light and layout typical of older terrace designs. A central skylight above the new stair core draws daylight deep into the interior. The rear extensions incorporate new living, kitchen, and bedroom zones.

Material selections—including concrete, steel, and timber—were deliberately modern but neutral, creating a respectful dialogue between old and new. Privacy was a critical design driver: window placement and screening were used to preserve amenity for both the site and its neighbours.

Blending design and construction expertise ensures a seamless project delivery. For architects seeking trusted collaborators, [B2B Listings](https://www.b2blistings.org/) is a valuable resource to discover consultants, suppliers, and contractors across the industry.

## Navigating Regulatory Complexity

Achieving DA for this project required careful navigation of multiple planning controls under the Newcastle LEP and DCP. This included:

- Height and FSR performance within a heritage context
- Heritage Impact Statement
- Visual impact and overshadowing analysis
- Consideration of acid sulphate soils (classified as low risk)

The proposal complies with Clause 5.10 of the LEP and satisfies Section 6.02 of the DCP regarding development in Heritage Conservation Areas.

## Urban Sensitivity Meets Spatial Efficiency

This Wolfe Street project demonstrates the application of **construction project management** expertise to private residential work:

- Adapting heritage typologies to contemporary living needs
- Coordinating consultants for mine subsidence, stormwater, heritage, and planning inputs
- Ensuring compliance through methodical documentation and engagement

Although modest in scale, the Wolfe Street DA showcases the attention to context, performance, and detail expected of projects in highly constrained urban environments.

## New Cabin in Mount Victoria: Designing for Landscape and Lifestyle

The second project proposed a new, low-impact cabin in Mount Victoria, within the Blue Mountains region. Designed for seasonal occupation and minimal site disturbance, the project focused on small-scale sustainability.

Design highlights included:

- Use of modular construction for off-site efficiency
- Siting strategies to preserve native vegetation and views
- Low-maintenance materials suited to the mountain climate

Like the Newcastle project, this design progressed to DA submission but was paused due to client indecision regarding budget and timeline.

## Balancing Creativity with Constructability

Across both projects, Yaxley’s role extended beyond conceptual design. Drawing on his construction project management background, he ensured that:

- Feasibility and buildability were addressed from early design stages
- Budget alignment and staging scenarios were explored with clients
- Planning risks and regulatory pathways were clearly scoped

"These projects reflect the kind of studio work that bridges aspirational design with delivery logic. It’s not just about aesthetics—it’s about creating the conditions for realisation," said Noel Yaxley.
