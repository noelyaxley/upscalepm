## Architectural Design Meets Practical Construction Project Management

In parallel with leading major public infrastructure projects, Noel Yaxley has delivered selected private commissions through Yaxley Studio and Upscale Group. These commissions demonstrate his combined strengths in architectural design and expert construction project management, particularly in sensitive urban contexts.

Upscale Project Management's founder brings a dual perspective that few project managers can offer: the ability to design and the ability to deliver. This combination is particularly valuable in residential projects where design quality and construction pragmatism must coexist.

## The Value of Dual Expertise

Most project managers come from construction or quantity surveying backgrounds. Noel's architectural training provides a fundamentally different lens:

- **Design intent preservation**: Understanding what the architect is trying to achieve and why, making it easier to find solutions when construction challenges arise
- **Material and detail knowledge**: Direct experience with specification, materiality, and detailing means better quality oversight on site
- **Planning and heritage fluency**: Architectural training includes deep exposure to planning legislation and heritage conservation principles
- **Visual communication**: The ability to sketch, draw, and visualise helps resolve issues on site quickly

<Callout type="tip" title="Architect-Trained PM">
  <p>When your project manager also thinks like a designer, design quality doesn't get lost in translation during construction. This is especially critical for heritage-sensitive and design-led residential projects.</p>

## Selected Private Commissions

The private commissions undertaken through Yaxley Studio and Upscale Group share common themes:

### Heritage-Sensitive Residential
Several projects involved alterations and additions to heritage-listed or heritage-adjacent dwellings. These require:

- Detailed heritage impact statements
- Sympathetic material selections
- Conservation of significant fabric
- Creative design responses that respect the existing building while introducing contemporary elements

### Design-Led Renovations
Other commissions focused on high-quality residential renovations where the design vision was the primary driver. The project management approach ensured that design ambition was matched by construction quality.

### End-to-End Delivery
For each commission, the scope covered the full project lifecycle:

1. Brief development and site analysis
2. Concept and detailed design
3. DA lodgement and approval
4. Construction documentation
5. Contractor procurement
6. Construction administration and quality oversight
7. Practical completion and handover

## The Takeaway

These private commissions illustrate a core philosophy at UpScale Project Management: good project management is not just about programme and budget. It's about understanding what makes a project excellent and having the skills to protect that excellence through every phase of delivery.
