## Stimulating Regional Economic Activity Through Land Use Reform

A well-crafted planning proposal has the potential to reshape communities and unlock new economic pathways. The rezoning initiative for parts of Peat Island and Mooney Mooney was one such strategic attempt -- aimed at facilitating commercial activity in a largely underutilised waterfront precinct north of Sydney.

The proposal formed part of a broader effort to catalyse tourism, employment, and infrastructure development in the Hawkesbury River region of the Central Coast.

## The Strategic Context

Peat Island and Mooney Mooney sit at the intersection of several competing priorities:

- **Economic opportunity**: The waterfront location offers significant potential for tourism, hospitality, and marine-related commercial activity
- **Environmental sensitivity**: The site adjoins ecologically significant waterways and bushland
- **Cultural heritage**: Aboriginal cultural heritage significance requires careful consideration and community engagement
- **Infrastructure limitations**: Existing road and service infrastructure constrains development potential
- **Government ownership**: Much of the land is government-owned, adding layers of approval and governance

<Callout type="info" title="What Is a Planning Proposal?">
  <p>A planning proposal is the formal process for changing the zoning or development controls that apply to land under NSW planning legislation. It can change what types of development are permitted, building heights, floor space ratios, and other planning controls.</p>
</Callout>

## The Proposal

The rezoning proposal sought to:

1. **Reclassify land** to enable tourism and commercial uses on currently restricted parcels
2. **Establish development controls** that balance economic activation with environmental protection
3. **Create an infrastructure framework** for staged delivery of supporting roads, services, and amenities
4. **Enable staged development** allowing the precinct to grow organically in response to market demand

## Project Management Role

UpScale's involvement focused on coordinating the technical and stakeholder dimensions of the planning process:

### Multi-Agency Coordination
The proposal required engagement with multiple government agencies, each with different jurisdictional interests:

- Central Coast Council (planning authority)
- NSW Department of Planning
- Environment and heritage agencies
- Transport and infrastructure authorities
- Government Property NSW (landowner)

### Community Engagement
Meaningful community engagement was essential given the site's cultural significance. The process included workshops with local Aboriginal communities, public exhibitions, and stakeholder briefings.

### Technical Studies
The proposal was supported by a suite of technical studies including environmental impact assessments, traffic and transport studies, infrastructure capacity analysis, and heritage assessments.

## The Outcome

The Peat Island and Mooney Mooney planning proposal demonstrated the complexity of strategic land use reform in environmentally and culturally sensitive locations. While the rezoning process involves extended timelines and multiple approval pathways, the groundwork laid through this proposal provides a framework for future development that balances economic opportunity with environmental and cultural responsibilities.
