# Steadying the Course in Late-Stage Project Delivery

Effective **project management delivery** doesn’t end when construction nears completion—often, it’s the final stage that demands the most attention to detail and stakeholder coordination. This was the case with the Newcastle Office Fit-Out, a government tenancy project requiring focused leadership after a mid-project management transition.

The recently completed 15,500 sqm office building at 6 Stewart Avenue is now Newcastle’s largest PCA A-grade offering. NSW government agencies leased 9,600 m² of modern A-grade workplace accommodation in the building, further solidifying its role as a central administrative hub. Situated in Newcastle West, the address is considered the city’s most connected and convenient commercial location—adjacent to a multi-modal transport interchange comprising trains, buses, and the new light rail—offering unrivalled access to the greater city and Sydney. Charter Hall acquired the property in August 2021, affirming its long-term value and appeal.

Noel Yaxley assumed responsibility during the final months of delivery, stepping in following the departure of the original project manager. His role centred on driving the project through its most critical closeout activities, ensuring quality, compliance, and stakeholder satisfaction.

## Project Management Delivery: Taking Over Midstream

Inheriting a project at the tail end of construction introduces unique challenges. Yaxley’s immediate priorities included:

- Conducting a detailed assessment of outstanding works and unresolved defects
- Establishing updated timelines for completion and occupancy readiness
- Re-engaging contractors and consultants to resolve quality issues

These efforts ensured that the project not only met its handover deadline but also adhered to the required workplace and compliance standards for a government fit-out. Bloc, a Canberra-based builder, was appointed to deliver the base building, with Yaxley coordinating closely during the fit-out transition.

## Managing Defects with Precision and Clarity

Defect rectification is a key component of late-stage **project management delivery**. Yaxley led the coordinated effort to close out remaining construction issues, leveraging clear documentation, regular inspections, and stakeholder alignment.

This phase included:

- Punch listing and verification of rectification works
- Finalising compliance and certification tasks
- Aligning fit-out elements with tenancy readiness requirements

"In the final stages, delivery becomes about momentum and focus. It's where precision and persistence ensure a successful transition from build to occupation," said Noel Yaxley.

## A Model for Responsive Project Handover

Despite stepping in late, Yaxley’s structured approach ensured continuity and mitigated the disruption caused by leadership transition. His work at Newcastle provides a clear example of how experienced **project management delivery**can stabilise and accelerate handover, even under changing circumstances.

## Conclusion: Final Stage Delivery with Lasting Impact

The Newcastle Office Fit-Out highlights the often-underestimated importance of final-phase **project management delivery**. From defect resolution to tenant readiness, Yaxley’s contribution ensured the project reached completion to the expected standard.

This experience reinforces a broader truth in project management: that consistent leadership and attention to detail in the final mile are vital to delivering quality, compliant, and occupiable workspaces.
