## Bridging Design and Delivery: The Granville Diggers Redevelopment

*By Upscale Project Management Founder, Noel Yaxley*

At Upscale Project Management, every successful project starts with one principle -- clarity. For founder Noel Yaxley, clarity isn't just about schedules and budgets; it's about ensuring that everyone involved truly understands what's being built, why it matters, and what it will take to make it real.

## The Origin Story

The Granville Diggers Club redevelopment didn't begin with a construction contract. It began with a conversation about the Club's future -- what the members wanted, what the site could support, and how to transform an ageing facility into something the community could be proud of for decades to come.

Noel was brought in to bridge the gap between the Club's board and their professional consultants. The role was part translator, part strategist, and part advocate -- ensuring the Club's interests were always at the centre of the project.

## Understanding the Stakeholders

One of the earliest challenges was alignment. The Club had a board of directors with varying levels of construction experience, an architect with a bold design vision, and a community with high expectations. Noel's first task was to create a common language:

- **Translating design into outcomes**: Helping the board understand what they were approving at each stage
- **Managing expectations**: Providing realistic cost and programme information early
- **Building trust**: Establishing clear communication channels between all parties

  <p>In community-driven projects, the project manager's most valuable skill is often translation -- converting technical complexity into clear, actionable information that decision-makers can confidently act on.</p>
</Callout>

## From Vision to Programme

With stakeholder alignment established, the focus shifted to converting the architectural vision into a deliverable programme. This meant:

1. Validating the design against planning and heritage requirements
2. Developing a procurement strategy that balanced cost certainty with design flexibility
3. Creating a staged delivery approach that would minimise disruption to the Club's operations
4. Establishing governance frameworks for decision-making during construction

The result was a project framework that gave the board confidence to move forward, knowing they had both a clear path to delivery and a trusted advisor managing the journey.

## Lessons for Community Organisations

The Granville Diggers project reinforces a principle we see across all our work: the earlier a client-side project manager is engaged, the smoother the project runs. For community organisations embarking on significant developments, having an experienced advocate from day one is not a luxury -- it's a necessity.
