The **Major Laboratory Relocation Project** represents a transformative investment by **Sydney Water** into the backbone of its scientific and filtration operations. With daily testing essential to the utility’s public health mandate, the move away from a dated 1980s lab in West Ryde marks a shift toward greater efficiency, resilience, and scalability in **Sydney water filtration** services.

**Noel Yaxley** led the early design and coordination phases, bringing together a multidisciplinary team to define, plan, and initiate the development of a new, purpose-built laboratory in **North Ryde**.

## From Redevelopment to Relocation: Adaptive Planning for Filtration Infrastructure

The original plan considered redeveloping the existing **West Ryde** site to maintain operational continuity. However, after detailed feasibility studies and cost assessments, relocating to **North Ryde** proved more viable. The shift allowed for a clean-slate approach tailored to the expanding needs of **Sydney water filtration systems**.

### Key Project Facts:

- **New location:** 11 Julius Avenue, North Ryde
- **Former site:** 51 Hermitage Road, West Ryde
- **Estimated value:** Approx. $35 million
- **Scope:** Multi-floor fit-out, including PC2-certified labs, dangerous goods (DG) storage, instrumentation rooms, offices, and collaboration zones
- **Completion target:** June 2026 (staged commissioning)
- **Delivery model:** Design & Construct, with early design finalisation
- **Technical features:** OGTR PC2 compliance, lab gas reticulation (N₂, H₂, He, CO₂, vacuum, zero air), UPS-backed systems, building management system (BMS), and fire engineering integration

## Supporting Sydney Water Filtration with Future-Ready Laboratory Design

Collaborating with lab specialists **TCA (Vino and Mark)** and **Jazzmax (New Zealand)**, Noel Yaxley led the technical briefing process for a state-of-the-art facility that supports both current and future **Sydney water filtration** requirements.

The design brief included:

- Zoning for lab workflows aligned with filtration and microbiology testing
- Future-proofed layouts for next-generation analytical equipment
- Integrated gas, fume extraction, and hazardous waste systems
- Lab safety aligned with filtration risk profiles and PC2 protocols

Every spatial and systems decision was made with **Sydney water filtration accuracy and reliability** in mind.

---

## Stakeholder Engagement and Lease Negotiation

The relocation required a year-long lease negotiation process involving landlords **Aqualand** and later **Wentworth Capital**, ensuring alignment between infrastructure goals and property terms.

Noel Yaxley led negotiations with support from **Design Manager Stephen Spitting** and a dedicated project coordinator. Securing the lease under favourable terms laid the foundation for streamlined delivery and long-term operational success.

---

## Construction & Delivery Readiness for Filtration Integrity

With the lease finalised, the project entered its delivery phase, involving:

- Complete lab and office fit-out
- Engineering services upgrades in a previously unoccupied building
- Specialised containment systems for PC2 compliance
- Careful staging in a **multi-tenant environment** to prevent disruption

A central concern during the construction phase is maintaining conditions that support **filtration testing precision**, even during the live transition. To this end, high-risk construction activities are being staged outside of critical testing periods.

The project also supports **Sydney Water’s Net Zero targets**, using low-energy HVAC, water-efficient fittings, and sustainable procurement for lab equipment and fit-out materials.

## BIM-Enabled Digital Delivery for Confidence and Control

The project leverages **Building Information Modelling (BIM)** for:

- Clash detection
- Ceiling services coordination
- Visual progress capture and documentation

This digital approach enhances transparency and enables stakeholders to track the quality and compliance of every element—critical in supporting the reliability of **Sydney water filtration** data and operations.

## Future-Proofing Sydney Water Filtration Capabilities

By investing in modular, efficient, and scalable laboratory infrastructure, Sydney Water is preparing its filtration and testing capabilities for decades to come.

From live pathogen monitoring to chemical analysis, this new facility is built to handle the evolving complexity of **Sydney water filtration systems**, population growth, and regulatory change.
