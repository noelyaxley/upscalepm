## Future-Proofing Critical Water Infrastructure

The Major Laboratory Relocation Project represents a transformative investment by Sydney Water into the backbone of its scientific and filtration operations. With daily testing essential to the utility's public health mandate, the move away from a dated 1980s lab in West Ryde marks a shift toward greater efficiency, resilience, and scalability in Sydney water filtration services.

Noel Yaxley led the early design management phase of this complex project, coordinating the interface between Sydney Water's scientific teams, the architectural consultants, and specialist laboratory designers.

## The Challenge

Relocating an operational laboratory is fundamentally different from building a new one. The facility needed to:

- **Maintain continuous operations**: Sydney Water's testing cannot stop, even during the transition
- **Accommodate specialised equipment**: Laboratory instruments require precise environmental controls, vibration isolation, and dedicated services
- **Meet regulatory standards**: NATA accreditation and public health compliance set non-negotiable quality thresholds
- **Future-proof the facility**: The new lab needed to accommodate emerging testing methodologies and expanded capacity

  <p>Sydney Water tests thousands of water samples daily. Any disruption to laboratory operations directly impacts the utility's ability to guarantee water quality for millions of Sydney residents.</p>

## Design Management Approach

The design phase required deep engagement with end users -- the scientists and technicians who would work in the new facility daily:

### User Requirements Capture
Detailed workshops with each scientific discipline identified specific spatial, environmental, and equipment requirements. These were documented and tracked through the design process.

### Specialist Coordination
Laboratory design demands coordination between general architectural design and specialist lab designers who understand equipment layouts, fume cupboard requirements, gas reticulation, and contamination control.

### Staging Strategy
A phased relocation plan was developed to ensure continuous operations, with teams moving in stages and temporary facilities bridging the transition.

## The Outcome

The new laboratory facility provides Sydney Water with a modern, efficient, and scalable platform for its critical testing operations. The project demonstrates the value of experienced design management in translating complex user requirements into built outcomes, particularly in specialised infrastructure where the cost of getting it wrong is measured in public health risk.
