# Delivering Complexity with Clarity: The Upscale PM Approach to Project Management

At Upscale Project Management, our work sits at the intersection of clarity, complexity, and confidence. We specialise in managing the delivery of highly technical spaces — from multi-agency commercial fit-outs to complex laboratory facilities — and guiding large teams through every phase of a project, from early planning to final handover. But just as important as the projects themselves is the philosophy behind how we work.

## A Journey Through the Built Environment

The path to founding Upscale PM was shaped by years of hands-on experience across architecture and project management. After completing a number of significant architectural projects under a previous partnership, I shifted into the commercial fit-out sector, taking on major roles within government agencies. This included projects at 231 Elizabeth Street in Sydney, a landmark multi-floor office fit-out, as well as other high-performing workspaces in Macquarie Park and Newcastle.

Each of these projects involved coordination with multiple stakeholders and agencies, alongside complex landlord integration. These experiences not only refined my understanding of project delivery at scale, but also highlighted a gap: the need for dedicated project leadership that truly understands both the technical and human dimensions of a build.

It was during this time that Sydney Water approached me to deliver their new headquarters in Parramatta — a pivotal moment that led to the formation of Upscale PM. The project brought together all the elements I had learned to value: stakeholder alignment, design translation, technical complexity, and the importance of a well-led, cohesive delivery team.

Today, we continue that work through current projects like Sydney Water’s new specialised laboratories in North Ryde — an 8,000 square metre facility that brings together science, infrastructure, and public outcomes in one of the state’s most advanced testing environments.

## Specialised Spaces, Specialised Knowledge

What sets laboratory and infrastructure projects apart from typical commercial work is their complexity. These are not just spaces to occupy — they are high-performance environments, often built to strict technical specifications, with rigorous demands on services coordination, compliance, and function.

My first exposure to this kind of space came during architectural work on the Charles Perkins Centre at the University of Sydney. It was here I first understood how demanding these projects can be — not just from a design perspective, but also from a coordination and delivery standpoint. Laboratories are often modular, but no two are the same. The systems required to support them — mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, data, and gas — must work seamlessly, and there is little margin for error.

It’s not simply about building a space. It’s about building the *right* space — and getting it right for the people who use it every day.

## Bridging the Gap Between Users and Consultants

One of the most overlooked — but critical — parts of project management is user group engagement. Many project managers focus heavily on delivery logistics but lack the tools to translate user needs into actionable design guidance. That’s where we come in.

With an architectural background and a strong design sensibility, I’m often able to act as the translator between user groups and consultant teams. Most end users aren’t trained to read architectural drawings or visualise how a layout will function in real life. But they do know what they need. Our job is to listen carefully, guide the conversation, and turn that feedback into something tangible that architects and engineers can work with.

That’s the real value we bring at Upscale PM: clarity in communication, confidence in process, and a deep respect for the role users play in shaping successful spaces.

## A Human-Centred Approach to Complex Projects

Ultimately, the heart of project delivery is people — whether it’s the end users, the client, the consultants, or the construction team. We believe every person involved in a project deserves to feel heard, supported, and aligned with a shared goal.

That’s why collaboration is embedded into every step of our process. We don’t manage from a distance. We lead from the middle — connecting stakeholders, solving problems proactively, and removing roadblocks before they become delays.

From boardroom presentations to on-site coordination, our focus is always on creating a sense of momentum, shared purpose, and accountability. Because successful delivery isn’t just about ticking boxes — it’s about building trust and ensuring that what’s delivered truly meets the needs of those who will use it.

## Looking Ahead

As we continue to grow Upscale PM, we’re committed to bringing our expertise to more complex, meaningful projects — whether in health, research, government, or infrastructure. We’re here to support organisations who are building not just for today, but for the future.

If you're planning a project with complex requirements, multiple stakeholders, or a tight timeline, we’d love to talk.
