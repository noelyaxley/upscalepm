## Delivering a Vision of Contemporary Urban Luxury

Calibre Cooper Street is a finely realised expression of contemporary residential design, located in one of Sydney's most vibrant inner-city neighbourhoods. The project introduces 18 high-quality apartments through a close collaboration between Koichi Takada Architects and Icon Oceania.

During his time at Root Partnerships, Noel Yaxley played a pivotal role in delivering this technically demanding project. The Surry Hills site presented significant constraints typical of inner-city development -- limited access, tight setbacks, and the need to respect the established streetscape character.

## Design Excellence Meets Practical Delivery

Koichi Takada Architects brought a distinctive design vision to Calibre Cooper Street, characterised by:

- **Organic facade elements** that create a dynamic street presence
- **Generous apartment layouts** maximising natural light and cross-ventilation
- **Premium material selections** including natural stone and timber
- **Integrated landscaping** connecting residents to greenery at every level

The project management challenge was to preserve this design ambition through the procurement and construction phases without compromising quality or budget.

## Navigating Inner-City Constraints

Building on a constrained Surry Hills site required meticulous coordination:

- **Site logistics**: Limited laydown areas and street access required careful sequencing of deliveries and crane operations
- **Neighbour management**: Close proximity to existing buildings demanded proactive communication and protective measures
- **Heritage interface**: The design needed to respond to the local heritage context while delivering a contemporary outcome
- **Council requirements**: City of Sydney's design excellence provisions set a high bar for material quality and sustainability

## The Result
