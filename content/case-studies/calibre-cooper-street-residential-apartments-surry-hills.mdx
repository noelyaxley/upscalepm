## Delivering a Vision of Contemporary Urban Luxury

Calibre Cooper Street is a finely realised expression of contemporary residential design, located in one of Sydney's most vibrant inner-city neighbourhoods. The project introduces 18 high-quality apartments through a close collaboration between Koichi Takada Architects and Icon Oceania.

During his time at Root Partnerships, Noel Yaxley played a pivotal role in delivering this technically complex development. From Land and Environment Court (LEC) approval through to tender, construction, and final handover, Noel's project leadership shaped the outcome—a project that continues to influence the detail-driven culture at Upscale Project Management.

## Overcoming Site and Planning Constraints

The site, just 303m² in area, is uniquely bounded by Cooper Street and O’Loughlin Street (a narrow rear lane). Construction logistics were a central challenge due to the constrained access and surrounding built-up context. Cooper Street is narrow and tree-lined, while the rear lane, O’Loughlin Street, has limited maneuverability and is similarly encumbered by large street trees.

The project required DA approval via the Land and Environment Court, secured on 15 May 2017. A key issue was the lift overrun providing rooftop terrace access, which breached the height limit planning control. The approval was granted under a design excellence scheme prepared by Koichi Takada Architects.

Further design challenges included:

- Zero-lot boundaries with neighbouring properties
- DA-imposed privacy setbacks that limited design flexibility
- Strict height limits requiring creative vertical design solutions

To maximise efficiency within height constraints, the team implemented post-tensioned structural slabs, maintaining a floor-to-floor height of 3.05m while achieving the 2.7m internal ceiling height mandated by the Apartment Design Guidelines.

## Architecture, Interiors, and Identity

Koichi Takada’s architectural language is fluid and organic, drawing inspiration from natural forms. The façade features glass and timber elements that soften its presence within the historic urban fabric of Surry Hills. These design moves not only enhance streetscape integration but also helped secure the LEC approval.

The internal planning is driven by daylight access, ventilation, and high-quality finishes. Apartments range from studio to two-bedroom layouts, capped by a rooftop penthouse with private pool and panoramic views. The open stair facing Cooper Street serves as both a design feature and fire egress, with a Fire Engineering Solution developed and approved by Fire NSW.

Key interior considerations included:

- Full-height glazing for maximum solar penetration and outlook
- Open-plan living to suit a range of user lifestyles
- High-spec finishes that aligned with market expectations
- Ceiling space optimisation to allow for concealed services

The project's marketing suite was innovatively housed within the existing commercial building on site, allowing buyers to experience the project context firsthand. This tactile approach boosted buyer confidence and created strong pre-sales momentum.

## Construction and Delivery

Calibre's construction cost was approximately $12 million, excluding site acquisition, consultant, lending, and developer costs. Financing was secured through ING Capital. The site logistics, heritage integration, and luxury design intent required rigorous coordination across consultants, builders, and service providers.

The development includes:

- 18 apartments across seven residential levels
- Rooftop entertainment area with private penthouse pool
- Single lift core and open stair for vertical circulation
- Basement-level car parking (9 spaces, including car stackers)
- Ground-floor retail and service rooms

The building form, technical detailing, and façade articulation were preserved throughout the construction process, in alignment with the DA-approved design excellence criteria.

"Calibre demanded the best from every team member. We had to resolve significant site, planning, and compliance challenges without compromising the design intent. This project taught me the value of persistence, creativity, and collaboration—principles that now guide our work at Upscale Group."

## A Blueprint for Boutique Urban Living

Calibre exemplifies what can be achieved when bold architecture, disciplined project delivery, and deep stakeholder coordination come together. More than just a building, it is a case study in urban refinement and the type of project Upscale Project Management is proud to have helped bring to life.
