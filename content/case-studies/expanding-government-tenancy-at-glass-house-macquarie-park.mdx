## Coordinated Fit-Out Delivery for Transport NSW

Located in Sydney's innovation corridor, the Glass House in Macquarie Park represents a growing trend of decentralised government tenancy within high-performance commercial precincts. For Transport NSW, the expansion within this building was both a spatial and strategic move -- increasing its footprint from six to eight floors and bringing the total occupied area to approximately 8,000 m².

Leading the project on behalf of Property NSW, Noel Yaxley managed the multi-floor expansion from initial planning through to practical completion, ensuring the project met government standards while accommodating Transport NSW's operational requirements.

## The Challenge

Expanding an existing government tenancy within an operating building presented several interlocking challenges:

- **Live environment**: Transport NSW operations continued on existing floors throughout the fit-out
- **Multi-floor coordination**: Two new floors needed to integrate seamlessly with the existing six
- **IT and security infrastructure**: Transport NSW's systems required continuous connectivity and compliance with government ICT standards
- **Stakeholder complexity**: Multiple divisions within Transport NSW had different workspace requirements
- **Programme pressure**: Lease commitments created firm deadlines for practical completion

## Delivery Approach

### Phased Construction
The fit-out was delivered in phases to minimise disruption:

1. New floor preparation and base building works
2. Fit-out of first additional floor while existing operations continued
3. Fit-out of second additional floor
4. Integration testing and commissioning across all eight floors

### Design Coordination
The workspace design needed to extend the existing design language established on the original six floors while incorporating updated workplace standards. This required close coordination between the interior designer, the base building landlord, and Transport NSW's workplace team.

### Contractor Management
Managing the construction contractor in a live government environment demanded:

- Strict access controls and security screening for all workers
- After-hours work for noisy trades to avoid disrupting operations
- Continuous dust and noise monitoring
- Daily coordination with building management

<Callout type="info" title="Decentralised Government Tenancy">
  <p>The Glass House expansion reflects a broader NSW Government strategy to decentralise office tenancy away from the CBD, reducing commute times for staff and contributing to the economic vitality of suburban innovation precincts.</p>
</Callout>

## The Outcome

The completed expansion provided Transport NSW with a modern, integrated workplace across eight floors of the Glass House. The project was delivered on programme and within budget, demonstrating effective client-side project management in a complex, multi-stakeholder environment.
