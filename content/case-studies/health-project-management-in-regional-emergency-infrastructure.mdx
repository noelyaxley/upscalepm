## Coordinated Delivery Across NSW: Rural Ambulance Station Projects

Working within the Health Infrastructure framework, the Rural Ambulance Infrastructure Reconfiguration (RAIR) program exemplifies the operational complexity and regional nuance of contemporary health project management. This initiative involved the delivery of multiple rural ambulance stations across New South Wales, including Birmingham Gardens near Newcastle and Port Macquarie.

## The RAIR Programme

The Rural Ambulance Infrastructure Reconfiguration program was developed in response to ageing ambulance station stock across regional NSW. Many existing facilities no longer met operational requirements, accessibility standards, or the needs of modern emergency response.

The programme required:

- **Standardised design** with local adaptations for each site
- **Multi-council coordination** across different local government areas
- **Operational continuity** ensuring ambulance services were maintained during construction
- **Interagency collaboration** between Health Infrastructure, NSW Ambulance, and local stakeholders

<Callout type="info" title="Modular Delivery">
  <p>The RAIR programme adopted a modular construction approach where possible, allowing components to be prefabricated off-site and assembled quickly. This minimised disruption to emergency services and reduced construction timeframes in remote locations.</p>
</Callout>

## Project Management Challenges

### Regional Logistics
Delivering construction projects in regional NSW presents unique challenges. Supply chains are longer, specialist trades may need to travel, and weather conditions can be less predictable. Effective programme management required contingency planning and flexible scheduling.

### Stakeholder Complexity
Each station had multiple stakeholders with different priorities:

- **Health Infrastructure** focused on compliance, budget, and programme
- **NSW Ambulance** prioritised operational functionality and response time maintenance
- **Local councils** had planning and community impact concerns
- **Local communities** wanted assurance that services would not be disrupted

### Compliance and Standards
Health infrastructure projects must meet stringent standards including:

- NSW Health design guidelines
- Accessibility requirements (DDA compliance)
- Essential services provisions
- Environmental sustainability targets

## The Outcome

The RAIR programme delivered modern, fit-for-purpose ambulance stations that serve their communities with improved operational capability. The project demonstrates the value of structured programme management in delivering multiple concurrent projects across geographically dispersed sites, while maintaining the rigour that health infrastructure demands.
