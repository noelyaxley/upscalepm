## Preserving Heritage, Enhancing Community

The Granville Diggers Club has been a valued part of Sydney's west since 1964, holding deep cultural and civic significance for the Granville community. Its site forms part of a broader heritage precinct that includes the Granville Memorial, commemorating the service and sacrifice of local residents.

The redevelopment represents a pivotal moment for the Club and its members. UpScale Project Management was engaged to provide full lifecycle project management, guiding the project from its earliest feasibility stage through design, procurement, and into construction delivery.

## From Feasibility to Reality

When UpScale first became involved, the challenge was not just about designing a new building. It was about understanding the community's aspirations, preserving heritage significance, and delivering a commercially viable development that would secure the Club's future for generations.

Our scope included:

- **Feasibility assessment** to validate the development's financial and planning viability
- **Design management** coordinating between the architect, engineers, and Club stakeholders
- **Heritage consultation** ensuring compliance with local heritage overlays
- **Procurement strategy** including tender preparation and contractor engagement
- **Contract administration** under AS4902 Design & Construct

## A Community-Centred Approach

What distinguishes the Granville Diggers project is the deep connection between the built outcome and the community it serves. Every design decision was evaluated not only against budget and programme but against the expectations of members who have called the Club home for decades.

UpScale's role as the client's representative has been to bridge the gap between design ambition and practical delivery, ensuring the project stays on track without losing sight of its community purpose.
