Within the Fit-Out and Workplace Division of Property NSW, the remit extended beyond simple tenancy coordination—it included shaping contemporary government workspaces that reflect evolving public sector needs. A standout example of this is the fit-out at **231 Elizabeth Street**, a landmark multi-floor tenancy in central Sydney.

Acting as client-side project manager, Noel Yaxley played a pivotal role in managing strategic and operational complexities, aligning agency requirements with construction realities to deliver a modern workplace solution.

## Integrated Fit-Out and Base Building Upgrades at 231 Elizabeth Street

The 231 Elizabeth Street project involved an integrated delivery model in which Shape served dual roles—executing both base building upgrades for Charter Hall and the complete government fit-out on behalf of Property NSW. This collaborative structure streamlined communication and ensured consistency across scopes.

The building now houses four major NSW government agencies: the Department of Planning and Environment (DPE), Transport for NSW (TfNSW), the Department of Customer Service (DCS), and the NSW Electoral Commission.

The project at **231 Elizabeth Street** involved the fit-out and relocation of four major NSW government agencies: the Department of Planning and Environment (DPE), Transport for NSW (TfNSW), the Department of Customer Service (DCS), and the NSW Electoral Commission. The building upgrade and fit-out were delivered in partnership with Shape, who were engaged for both base building works on behalf of Charter Hall and the full tenancy fit-out on behalf of Property NSW.

Coordinating two parallel construction streams required detailed risk management to avoid delays and ensure quality outcomes. Yaxley oversaw tenancy works across levels 2–15 and a complete fit-out on level 1, balancing sequencing challenges, access restrictions, and complex stakeholder communications.

## From Leasing to Fit-Out: A Strategic Delivery Model

Yaxley’s role extended beyond design and delivery. As part of Property NSW’s broader strategy, he supported site selection and lease negotiations for government clients. Early-stage test fits helped ensure each agency’s operational model aligned with the available space.

Once a lease was signed, Yaxley managed:

- Tendering and builder engagement
- Coordination of interior architecture and building services
- Base building upgrades including HVAC, fire safety, and compliance
- Integration of IT and AV infrastructure to support hybrid work modes

This full-spectrum delivery model improved speed, quality, and alignment between landlords, tenants, and contractors.

## Fit-Outs Designed for Function, Flexibility, and Future Growth

The fit-out design at **231 Elizabeth Street** was purpose-built to support hybrid working, collaborative environments, and accessibility. With varying agency needs, customisation was key. Key outcomes included:

- Open-plan layouts supported by quiet zones and shared meeting areas
- Durable finishes aligned with long-term government use
- Integrated digital infrastructure to support remote connectivity
- Flexibility for future changes without major rework

Each level was delivered sequentially to align with agency relocation schedules, requiring high-level coordination and rapid issue resolution.

## Delivering Under Pressure: Reflections from the Field

"Projects like 231 Elizabeth Street prove that complex public sector fit-outs can be delivered on time and to a high standard when strategic project leadership is in place," said Noel Yaxley. "Balancing stakeholder demands, construction phasing, and quality assurance on a live site requires agility, discipline, and experience."

## 231 Elizabeth Street: Setting a New Benchmark for Government Workplaces

The success of **231 Elizabeth Street** reflects the strength of integrated delivery models and client-side leadership in government projects. With multiple agencies co-located under one roof and a seamless alignment between base building and fit-out, the project sets a new benchmark for public sector workplace transformation in Sydney.

This case study illustrates how Upscale Project Management supports strategic delivery from lease negotiation through to handover—bridging the gap between design intent and operational reality.
