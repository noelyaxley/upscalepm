## Shaping Contemporary Government Workspaces

Within the Fit-Out and Workplace Division of Property NSW, the remit extended beyond simple tenancy coordination -- it included shaping contemporary government workspaces that reflect evolving public sector needs. A standout example of this is the fit-out at 231 Elizabeth Street, a landmark multi-floor tenancy in central Sydney.

Acting as client-side project manager, Noel Yaxley played a pivotal role in managing strategic and operational aspects of this complex fit-out project.

## The Brief

Property NSW required modern, flexible workspaces for multiple government agencies within the building. The fit-out needed to:

- **Support agile working** with a mix of open plan, collaborative, and quiet zones
- **Accommodate multiple agencies** each with different operational requirements
- **Meet government standards** for accessibility, sustainability, and workplace health
- **Deliver within programme** to align with lease commencement dates
- **Maintain building operations** in a live commercial environment

## Design and Delivery Approach

### Multi-Agency Coordination
One of the project's key complexities was coordinating the requirements of multiple government agencies. Each had different spatial needs, security requirements, and IT infrastructure demands. The design process required extensive stakeholder engagement to develop layouts that served each agency while maintaining a cohesive design language.

### Live Building Environment
The fit-out was delivered within an operating commercial building, requiring careful management of:

- **Access and logistics** including goods lifts, loading dock scheduling, and noise restrictions
- **Building management** coordination with the landlord's facilities team
- **Adjacent tenancy protection** ensuring construction did not impact neighbouring occupants
- **Base building interface** connecting new fit-out works to existing services

### Sustainability and Compliance
The fit-out was designed and delivered to meet government sustainability targets, including:

- NABERS Energy and water efficiency ratings
- Green Star Interior specifications
- Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) standards
- Recycled content and low-VOC material requirements

<Callout type="tip" title="Government Fit-Out Insight">
  <p>Government workspace fit-outs demand a balance between standardisation (for efficiency and compliance) and customisation (to serve each agency's specific operational needs). The project manager's role is to navigate this tension while keeping the project on programme and budget.</p>
</Callout>

## The Outcome

The 231 Elizabeth Street fit-out delivered modern, efficient workspaces that set a new benchmark for government tenancy projects. The project demonstrates the value of experienced client-side project management in navigating multi-stakeholder complexity while maintaining design quality and programme certainty.
