## A Staged Path to Delivery

The Granville Diggers Club redevelopment is now entering a significant new phase with the appointment of James Clifford Construction as the Design & Construct (D&C) contractor. Engaged under an AS4902 contract, the project will be delivered across separable portions, allowing for a clear and strategic approach to achieving key milestones.

## Why AS4902 Design & Construct?

The selection of AS4902 as the contract framework was a deliberate decision driven by the project's specific requirements:

- **Single point of responsibility**: D&C places design development and construction under one contractor, reducing interface risk
- **Cost certainty**: A lump-sum D&C contract provides the Club with a fixed price, essential for a community organisation managing member funds
- **Design flexibility**: The contractor can optimise buildability while maintaining the architect's design intent
- **Risk transfer**: Key construction risks are allocated to the party best positioned to manage them

<Callout type="tip" title="Choosing the Right Contract">
  <p>AS4902 is particularly suited to projects where the client wants cost certainty but the design still requires development. The separable portions mechanism adds further flexibility by allowing staged completion and handover.</p>
</Callout>

## Separable Portions: A Strategic Tool

The use of separable portions in this project serves multiple purposes:

### Portion 1: Design Development and Certification
The first separable portion covers the completion of detailed design and obtaining all necessary certifications. This ensures the design is fully resolved and approved before major construction works commence.

### Portion 2: Construction and Fitout
The second portion encompasses the physical construction, internal fitout, and commissioning of the new facility. By separating this from design development, the programme provides clear milestones for both the contractor and the Club.

### Portion 3: Handover and Defects
The final portion covers practical completion, handover to the Club, and the commencement of the defects liability period.

## The Role of Client-Side PM

Throughout this process, UpScale Project Management continues to act as the Club's representative, providing:

- **Contract administration** under the AS4902 framework
- **Programme monitoring** to track progress against milestones
- **Quality oversight** ensuring the design intent is maintained through construction
- **Stakeholder communication** keeping the Club's board and members informed
- **Variation management** assessing and negotiating any changes to scope
