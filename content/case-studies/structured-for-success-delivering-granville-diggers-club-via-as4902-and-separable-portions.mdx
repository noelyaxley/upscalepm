# A Staged Path to Delivery: Granville Diggers Club Moves Forward with James Clifford Construction

The Granville Diggers Club redevelopment is now entering a significant new phase with the appointment of James Clifford Construction as the Design & Construct (D&C) contractor. Engaged under an **AS4902 contract**, the project will be delivered across **separable portions**, allowing for a clear and strategic approach to achieving key milestones — first in design finalisation and approvals, and then in construction and fit-out delivery.

As Project Manager, Upscale PM has played a central role in structuring this approach, ensuring that the development continues to balance heritage sensitivity, operational needs, and timely delivery.

## Separable Portions: A Smart Strategy for Staged Delivery

To manage the complexity of the Granville Diggers Club redevelopment — a site with deep community roots, ongoing operations, and layered design requirements — the project has been divided into two **Separable Portions (SPs)** under the AS4902 D&C framework.

- **Separable Portion 1 (SP1):** Focuses on completing the design and securing the **Construction Certificate (CC)** by the end of December.
- **Separable Portion 2 (SP2):** Covers the **construction and stage one fit-out**, commencing in **February** and running through to **mid-July** 2026.

This two-stage approach enables critical design refinements to occur with the right level of care and consultation, particularly given the building’s heritage context, while setting a firm pathway for delivery and managing risk on both sides of the contract.

## The Role of Upscale PM

Our involvement to date has been deeply collaborative, supporting the club board and working closely with **GeriesPayne Architects** to shape a vision that respects the club’s legacy and enhances its role in the community.

Now, in partnership with **James Clifford Construction**, Upscale PM is facilitating a smooth transition from DA approval into detailed design, certification, and construction readiness. Key responsibilities during SP1 include:

- **Managing design development** workshops and stakeholder input.
- Coordinating with certifiers to secure the CC by the December deadline.
- Ensuring alignment across architectural, structural, and building services disciplines.
- Holding regular reporting and risk reviews to maintain schedule clarity.

Once SP2 commences in February, our focus will shift to on-site coordination, contractor interface management, cost and time oversight, and maintaining clear lines of communication with the club leadership to support decision-making.

## A Club Development with Deep Community Value

For over 60 years, the Granville Diggers Club has been a central gathering place in Western Sydney — not just as a venue, but as a civic landmark woven into the area’s social and commemorative history. The redevelopment is not just about upgrading a building. It’s about **preserving identity while preparing for the future**.

The new scheme introduces:

- Expanded **dining and bar facilities**
- A flexible **performance stage**
- A dedicated **children’s play space**
- Improved **reception and circulation areas**

These upgrades will support broader member engagement, enhance revenue streams, and strengthen the club’s financial sustainability — all while ensuring that the club’s **original character and cultural significance** remain visible and respected.

## D&C Delivery with Design Integrity

One of the project’s strengths is the shared commitment — across client, architect, and builder — to ensure design quality is not compromised in the D&C transition. The AS4902 framework provides the right contractual structure to maintain accountability while giving James Clifford Construction the autonomy to plan and execute works efficiently.

With SP1 focused on detailed documentation and coordination, there is the opportunity to refine and lock in key design elements with clarity. This means fewer compromises during construction, better cost control, and a smoother delivery timeline.

## What’s Next?

Over the coming months, the focus will be on finalising the design package, obtaining the Construction Certificate, and preparing the site and contracts for SP2. By **early February**, construction will be underway, delivering the first stage of a revitalised venue by **mid-July 2026**.

Throughout this process, Upscale PM will continue to lead with transparency, rigour, and alignment — ensuring that every stakeholder remains informed and engaged, and that decisions are made with both heritage and long-term functionality in mind.

## A Model for Future Club Developments

This project sets an example for how community clubs can evolve — not just through bold architecture, but through thoughtful planning and strong project leadership. The use of a **separable portions strategy under AS4902** allows for agility and risk mitigation, without losing sight of the big picture.

If you’re involved in the planning or upgrade of a heritage-sensitive or multi-stakeholder venue, Upscale PM can help. We bring experience in **feasibility analysis, stakeholder coordination, D&C delivery**, and aligning design vision with project realities.
