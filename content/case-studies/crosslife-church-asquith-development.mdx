## Client-Side Project Management for Community Organisations

At UpScale Project Management, we specialise in helping community organisations turn their visions into reality. The CrossLife Church development in Asquith is a strong example of how careful planning, contract administration, and client-side advocacy can guide a project smoothly from feasibility into construction.

## The Challenge

CrossLife Church approached UpScale with a vision to develop a new facility that would serve their growing congregation and the broader Asquith community. Like many community organisations, the Church had ambitious goals but limited experience navigating the complexities of property development.

The key challenges included:

- Navigating the DA approval process with Hornsby Shire Council
- Managing a constrained budget funded by the congregation
- Coordinating between multiple consultants and stakeholders
- Ensuring the design met both worship and community use requirements
- Maintaining transparency and trust with Church leadership throughout

## Our Approach

UpScale was engaged from the earliest feasibility stage, providing the Church with a clear roadmap from concept to completion:

### Feasibility and Planning
We assessed the site's development potential, validated the budget against market costs, and prepared the Church leadership for the journey ahead. This early engagement ensured expectations were realistic and the project was set up for success.

### Design Coordination
Working closely with the architect and engineering consultants, we managed the design process to ensure it met the Church's functional requirements while remaining within budget. Regular design review meetings kept all stakeholders aligned.

### Procurement and Contract
We prepared tender documentation, managed the contractor selection process, and administered the construction contract on behalf of the Church. Our role was to protect the Church's interests at every stage.

### Construction Oversight
During construction, UpScale provided ongoing superintendent services, monitoring progress, quality, and compliance. Regular reporting kept the Church leadership informed without burdening them with day-to-day construction management.

  <p>Community organisations benefit most from early engagement with a client-side project manager. The earlier we are involved, the more effectively we can protect the organisation's interests and manage risk.</p>

## Outcome

The CrossLife Church development demonstrates that community projects, when managed with the same rigour as commercial developments, can be delivered on time and within budget. UpScale's role as the Church's trusted advocate ensured the project progressed smoothly, with the Church leadership confident in every decision made along the way.
