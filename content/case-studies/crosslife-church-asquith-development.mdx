## Crosslife Church Asquith Development

### Client Side Project Management

At UpScale Project Management, we specialise in helping community organisations turn their visions into reality. One of our recent projects, CrossLife Church in Asquith, is a great example of how careful planning, contract administration, and client-side advocacy can guide a project smoothly from feasibility into construction.

CrossLife Church had a clear goal: to upgrade and expand their facilities to create a welcoming, flexible, and accessible environment for worship, connection, and community events. Their existing building was well-loved, but it no longer met the needs of a growing and diverse congregation.

The vision for the redevelopment included:

- A new welcoming foyer with a bay window and lofty ceiling that immediately communicates openness and hospitality.
- A new worship space with improved audio-visual systems for sermons, music, and events.
- An accessible toilet that ensures inclusivity for all members and visitors.
- A new kitchen that supports community functions, gatherings, and hospitality.
- A crying room that allows parents and carers with young children to stay connected to worship in comfort.

This scope required not just good design, but also a carefully managed process that would allow the church to make informed decisions, control costs, and minimise risks.

## Our Role: Client-Side Project Management

As client-side project managers, UpScale PM acted as the independent representative of CrossLife Church throughout the early stages of the project. Our responsibilities included:

- **Organising the PPR (Project Planning Report):** This document set out the scope, budget, and timeline in clear terms, ensuring that all stakeholders were aligned before commitments were made.
- **Advising on contract selection:** Most commercial projects in Sydney use the MBA BC3 contract, which we reviewed and tailored to suit the church's specific needs. We explained its key clauses — such as liquidated damages, delay costs, retention, and variations — so the church leadership understood exactly what they were signing.
- **Contract negotiation and administration:** By preparing the contract and ensuring the builder's obligations were clearly set out, we reduced risk and positioned the client for a smoother construction phase.
- **Managing tender and appointment:** Working with Chung Architects, we guided the project through consultant coordination, builder engagement, and the early stages of mobilisation.

Our goal throughout was to give the church clarity and confidence, translating technical details into plain language and ensuring the leadership team had the information they needed to make sound decisions.

## Collaboration with Chung Architects

The design vision was led by Chung Architects, who brought sensitivity and creativity to the project. Their approach focused on making the building feel open, light-filled, and welcoming, while delivering practical upgrades that will serve the congregation for decades.

The foyer, with its bay window and lofty ceiling, is designed as both a gathering space and a gesture of invitation to the wider community. The new worship space will be supported by improved audio-visual systems, allowing CrossLife Church to expand its programming and reach. Practical needs, like the new kitchen and accessible toilet, are addressed with equal care, while the inclusion of a crying room ensures families with young children can participate fully in the life of the church.

UpScale PM worked closely with Chung Architects to align the design vision with budgetary and program constraints, ensuring that the project remained achievable without compromising on its community-focused goals.

## Commencing Construction

With the PPR in place, contracts finalised, and a clear scope defined, the project is now in the construction phase. This milestone marks the result of careful preparation and collaboration between the client, architect, and project team.

For CrossLife Church, this means the redevelopment is no longer just an idea — it's becoming a reality. For UpScale PM, it's another example of how client-side project management can empower community organisations to navigate complex construction processes with confidence.

## Why This Matters

Community projects like this one are about more than bricks and mortar. They are about creating spaces that bring people together, support wellbeing, and reflect shared values. For CrossLife Church, the new foyer, worship space, and community facilities will be central to their mission of hospitality and connection.

At UpScale PM, we take pride in helping clients achieve these outcomes. By managing risk, clarifying contracts, and keeping the process transparent, we free clients to focus on their vision, not the fine print.

## Looking Ahead

As construction progresses, the CrossLife Church project will deliver a space that is more accessible, more welcoming, and better equipped to serve the Asquith community. From the first PPR document to the signing of the MBA BC3 contract, our role has been to stand alongside the client as a trusted advisor and advocate.

We look forward to seeing the completed building come to life — a space shaped by thoughtful design, supported by robust project management, and enriched by the values of the community it serves.
