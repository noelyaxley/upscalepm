## Client-Side Project Management for Community Organisations

At UpScale Project Management, we specialise in helping community organisations turn their visions into reality. CrossLife Church in Asquith is a great example of how careful planning, contract administration, and client-side advocacy can guide a project smoothly from feasibility into construction.

CrossLife Church had a clear goal: to upgrade and expand their facilities to create a welcoming, flexible, and accessible environment for worship, connection, and community events. Their existing building was well-loved, but it no longer met the needs of a growing and diverse congregation.

## Vision for Redevelopment

The Church's vision for the redevelopment included:

- A new welcoming foyer with a bay window and lofty ceiling that immediately communicates openness and hospitality
- A new worship space with improved audio-visual systems for sermons, music, and events
- An accessible toilet that ensures inclusivity for all members and visitors
- A new kitchen that supports community functions, gatherings, and hospitality
- A crying room that allows parents and carers with young children to stay connected to worship in comfort

## Our Role: Client-Side Project Management

UpScale was engaged from the earliest feasibility stage, providing the Church with a clear roadmap from concept to completion. Our services included:

- **Organising the PPR (Project Planning Report):** This document set out the scope, budget, and timeline in clear terms, ensuring that all stakeholders were aligned before commitments were made
- **Advising on contract selection:** Most commercial projects in Sydney use the MBA BC3 contract, which we reviewed and tailored to suit the church's specific needs. We explained its key clauses — such as liquidated damages, delay costs, retention, and variations — so the church leadership understood exactly what they were signing
- **Contract negotiation and administration:** By preparing the contract and ensuring the builder's obligations were clearly set out, we reduced risk and positioned the client for a smoother construction phase
- **Managing tender and appointment:** We managed the competitive tender process and guided the Church through builder selection, ensuring Radial Projects was the right fit for the project

  <p>Community organisations benefit most from early engagement with a client-side project manager. The earlier we are involved, the more effectively we can protect the organisation's interests and manage risk.</p>

## Outcome

The CrossLife Church development demonstrates that community projects, when managed with the same rigour as commercial developments, can be delivered on time and within budget. UpScale's role as the Church's trusted advocate ensured the project progressed smoothly, with the Church leadership confident in every decision made along the way.
