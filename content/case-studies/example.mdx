## Project Overview

This is a placeholder case study used to verify the MDX content pipeline. It tests that YAML frontmatter is correctly parsed and not rendered as visible content on the page.

The project involved managing a complex commercial fit-out in the heart of Sydney's CBD, requiring coordination across multiple trades and tight timelines.

## Key Challenges

- Coordinating works within an occupied building
- Managing heritage overlay requirements
- Delivering within a compressed 12-week programme
- Navigating council approval processes

## Approach

Our team took a structured approach to delivery, focusing on early contractor engagement and proactive risk management. The result was a project delivered on time and within budget.
