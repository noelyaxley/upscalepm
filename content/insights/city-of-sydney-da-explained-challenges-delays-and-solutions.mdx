## Why the City of Sydney DA Process Is Failing Developers -- and Buyers

The City of Sydney DA (Development Application) process is meant to balance good design, planning compliance, and community needs. In practice, however, it has become a drawn-out, rigid, and costly system that is deterring developers, adding years of delays, and inflating housing prices.

A recent case highlights just how challenging the process has become.

## The Problem with Sydney's DA Process

The DA process in Sydney is governed by the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 and the various Local Environmental Plans (LEPs) and Development Control Plans (DCPs) that councils maintain. For developments within the City of Sydney, the system layers multiple controls on top of each other -- heritage overlays, design excellence panels, floor space ratio limits, and height restrictions.

On paper, these controls serve important purposes. In reality, they create a web of requirements that can take years to untangle.

<Callout type="warning">
A single DA in the City of Sydney can take 12 to 24 months to determine -- and that is before any appeal or modification. Complex projects can face 3+ years in the planning system before a shovel hits the ground.

## Key Challenges Developers Face

### 1. Excessive Assessment Timeframes

Council assessment officers are often dealing with large caseloads and limited resources. Pre-DA meetings, while valuable in theory, can add months before a formal application is even lodged.

### 2. Design Excellence Requirements

For larger developments, the City of Sydney requires a Design Excellence process -- often involving an architectural competition or a Design Review Panel. While intended to lift design quality, this adds significant time and cost to the project.

### 3. Rigid Interpretation of Controls

Planning controls are sometimes interpreted so strictly that even minor departures trigger lengthy negotiations, additional reports, or outright refusals -- even where the departure has negligible impact.

### 4. Community Objection Dynamics

Public notification periods can generate objections that extend assessment times. While community input is important, the process for addressing objections can slow approvals considerably.

## What Can Developers Do?

Despite these challenges, developers can take steps to improve their chances of a smoother DA process:

- **Engage early with council** -- Pre-DA meetings, while imperfect, help identify deal-breakers before you invest heavily in documentation.
- **Invest in quality documentation** -- A complete, well-prepared application reduces requests for additional information.
- **Work with experienced consultants** -- Planners, architects, and project managers who know the City of Sydney's expectations can navigate the process more efficiently.
- **Consider alternative approval pathways** -- Complying Development Certificates (CDCs) and State Significant Development (SSD) pathways bypass some council bottlenecks for eligible projects.
- **Appoint a client-side project manager** -- Someone who coordinates the entire team, manages timelines, and keeps the process on track.

## The Bigger Picture

The DA process in the City of Sydney needs reform. Housing supply is constrained, construction costs are rising, and lengthy approvals only make the situation worse. Until systemic changes happen, developers need to be strategic, well-prepared, and well-supported.
