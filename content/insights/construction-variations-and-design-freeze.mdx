## Why a Design Freeze Can Save Your Budget

You have worked with your architect, you have worked with your service engineers, and you have refined the drawings. At some point, you want to essentially **freeze that design** -- because making changes once construction has started costs time, money, and sometimes goodwill.

Once a project is tendered and the contractor is on site, every change you request is classified as a **variation**. And every variation comes with a cost -- not just for the work itself, but for the disruption it causes.

## What Is a Design Freeze?

A design freeze is a deliberate decision point where the client and design team agree that the design is complete and no further changes will be made. From this point forward, the drawings and specifications become the basis for the construction contract.

This does not mean the design has to be perfect -- it means it has to be **agreed**.

A design freeze is not about perfection. It is about agreement. Lock in the decisions that matter and manage any remaining items as allowances or provisional sums within the contract.

## The True Cost of Variations

When a variation is issued during construction, the costs go beyond the direct work:

- **Direct cost** -- Labour, materials, and subcontractor charges for the changed work
- **Preliminary costs** -- Extended site time for the contractor's management team
- **Disruption costs** -- Re-sequencing of trades, idle time, and rework
- **Programme impact** -- Delays that push completion dates back
- **Claims risk** -- Contractors can claim for delay and disruption caused by the variation, even if the direct cost seems small

### A Real Example

On one project, a client requested a change to the bathroom tiling layout three weeks after the tiler had started. The direct cost of the new tiles was $2,000. The total variation, including removal of installed tiles, re-waterproofing, re-tiling, and programme delay, came to $18,000.

## How to Implement an Effective Design Freeze

1. **Set a clear freeze date** -- Agree on this date early in the project programme and communicate it to the entire team.
2. **Complete all selections** -- Finishes, fixtures, fittings, and equipment must be confirmed before the freeze.
3. **Resolve coordination issues** -- Structural, mechanical, electrical, and hydraulic drawings must be coordinated and cross-checked.
4. **Client sign-off** -- The client must formally approve the design package. This is their last opportunity to make changes without cost implications.
5. **Document the baseline** -- The frozen design becomes the contractual baseline against which all future changes are measured.

## When Changes Are Unavoidable

Sometimes changes are genuinely necessary -- unforeseen site conditions, regulatory requirements, or critical functionality gaps. In these cases:

- **Assess the cost and programme impact** before approving
- **Issue a formal variation instruction** through the contract administrator
- **Negotiate the variation value** before the work is carried out, where possible
- **Track all variations** in a variation register to maintain an up-to-date picture of the project budget
