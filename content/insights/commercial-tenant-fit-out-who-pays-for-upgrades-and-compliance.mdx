## What You Need to Know Before Signing a Lease

A commercial tenant fit out can be an exciting opportunity to create a workspace that reflects your brand, improves productivity, and sets the right impression for clients. But for many tenants, the process comes with unexpected costs and responsibilities -- especially when it comes to understanding where the landlord's role ends and where the tenant's begins.

## Who Pays for What?

The split between landlord and tenant responsibilities is one of the most common sources of confusion -- and dispute -- in commercial fit-outs. Here is how it typically breaks down:

### Landlord Responsibilities (Base Building)

The landlord is generally responsible for delivering the premises in a "base building" condition. This usually includes:

- Structural elements (floors, walls, ceiling grid)
- Base building services (fire services to code, air conditioning to the floor, electrical distribution boards)
- Common area finishes (lobbies, lifts, amenities)
- BCA compliance for the base building

### Tenant Responsibilities (Fit-Out Works)

The tenant is responsible for everything that turns a bare shell into a functional workspace:

- Internal partitioning and layout
- Floor coverings, wall finishes, and joinery
- Lighting and power distribution to workstations
- Data and communications cabling
- Kitchen and breakout areas
- Signage

The grey area between "base building" and "tenant fit-out" is where disputes happen. Always clarify the exact scope of landlord works **before** signing the lease.

## The Hidden Costs Most Tenants Miss

### 1. BCA and Compliance Upgrades

If the building is older, your fit-out may trigger compliance upgrades -- fire systems, accessibility, mechanical ventilation -- that the landlord has been deferring. These costs can land on the tenant if the lease is not carefully negotiated.

### 2. Make-Good Obligations

Most leases require the tenant to return the premises to their original condition at the end of the lease. This can cost tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars. Understand your make-good obligations from day one.

### 3. Services Upgrades

The base building air conditioning may not meet the demands of your fitout. Adding supplementary cooling, increasing electrical capacity, or upgrading fire systems are all potential additional costs.

### 4. Authority Approvals

Depending on the scope, you may need a DA, a CDC, or a Construction Certificate. These require consultant reports, council fees, and time.

## How to Protect Your Budget

- **Get a fit-out scope of works** from an independent project manager before negotiating the lease
- **Negotiate landlord contributions** -- many landlords will offer an incentive (cash or works) to secure a good tenant
- **Clarify the base building condition** in the lease -- what is included and what is excluded
- **Engage a building services consultant** early to identify any capacity constraints
- **Budget for contingencies** -- 10-15% is standard for fit-out projects

An independent project manager can review the lease, assess the premises, and provide a realistic budget before you commit. [Talk to Upscale PM](/contact) about your next fit-out.
