## Most Commercial Projects in Sydney Use the MBA BC3 Contract -- But Do You Actually Know What's Inside It?

If you are a developer, business owner, or part of a community group looking to deliver a commercial project in Sydney, chances are your builder will present you with the **MBA BC3 contract**. It is the industry standard for most commercial works across New South Wales.

But here is the real question: do you actually know what is inside it?

## What Is the MBA BC3?

The MBA BC3 is a standard form construction contract published by Master Builders Australia (MBA). It is designed for commercial building works and is widely used across NSW for projects ranging from fit-outs to multi-storey developments.

The contract covers:

- Scope of works and contract sum
- Programme and completion dates
- Variations and adjustments
- Payment terms and claims
- Defects and rectification
- Dispute resolution

<Callout type="info">
The MBA BC3 is a **builder-friendly** contract. It was drafted by the Master Builders Association. That does not mean it is unfair, but it does mean the client needs to understand the clauses and their implications.

## Key Clauses Every Client Should Know

### 1. Variations (Clause 17)

The variations clause gives the contractor the right to claim additional costs for any change to the scope of works. This includes changes requested by the client, changes required by authorities, and changes arising from discrepancies in the documents.

**What to watch for:** Ensure your documentation is thorough before signing. Incomplete drawings or specifications are a common trigger for variations.

### 2. Extensions of Time (Clause 19)

The contractor can claim extensions of time for delays caused by the client, the architect, authorities, industrial disputes, inclement weather, and a range of other causes.

**What to watch for:** The list of qualifying causes is broad. If you cause delays (late decisions, late information, scope changes), the contractor is entitled to more time -- and potentially more money.

### 3. Practical Completion (Clause 21)

Practical completion is the point at which the works are complete except for minor defects that do not prevent the building from being used for its intended purpose.

**What to watch for:** Disputes over what constitutes "practical completion" are common. Ensure the contract clearly defines the criteria and the process for handover.

### 4. Defects Liability Period (Clause 22)

After practical completion, there is a defects liability period (typically 12 months) during which the contractor must rectify any defects that appear.

**What to watch for:** Document all defects promptly and formally. Verbal requests are difficult to enforce.

### 5. Security (Clause 5)

The client typically holds a percentage of the contract sum as security (retention) to ensure the contractor fulfils their obligations.

**What to watch for:** Understand when security is released and what recourse you have if defects are not rectified.

## Why You Need a Client-Side PM

The MBA BC3 is a comprehensive document, but it is not a substitute for active project management. A client-side project manager:

- Reviews the contract before signing and identifies risks
- Manages the contract administration process
- Assesses variations and protects the budget
- Monitors programme compliance and flags delays early
- Coordinates the handover and defects process

Do not sign a construction contract without independent advice. [Contact Upscale PM](/contact) to discuss contract review and client-side project management.
