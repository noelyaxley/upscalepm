## Rethinking Work-Life Balance in the Built Environment

Last night I had dinner with John Prigell, one of the directors and founding members of SGB Architecture. John moved from Melbourne to establish SGB's Sydney office and now leads much of the firm's work around people and culture.

Our conversation turned to work-life balance -- that ever-present topic in architecture and construction. John shared that, like many firms after COVID, SGB had embraced flexibility and adjusted expectations around hours and availability. But he also made an observation that stuck with me: the best work often comes from periods of intensity.

Not burnout. Not exploitation. But genuine, purposeful intensity -- the kind that happens when a team is aligned, energised, and committed to delivering something meaningful.

## The Balance Myth

The construction industry has a complicated relationship with work-life balance. For decades, the culture was simple: long hours, hard work, and a "get it done" mentality. That culture produced results, but it also produced burnout, high turnover, and mental health challenges.

The pendulum has swung -- and rightly so. We now talk openly about wellbeing, flexibility, and sustainable workloads. These conversations are important and necessary.

But somewhere in the shift, we may have lost something too.

Balance does not mean doing less. It means doing meaningful work in a sustainable way. The goal is not to avoid intensity -- it is to ensure that intensity has purpose.

## What I Have Learned from Project Delivery

Over the past fifteen years, I have delivered projects across residential, commercial, hospitality, and community sectors. Some of my best experiences -- and best outcomes -- came during the most demanding periods.

### Intensity Creates Focus

When a project is in its critical phase -- the last push before practical completion, a complex coordination challenge, a tight approval deadline -- the team sharpens. Communication improves. Decision-making accelerates. Unnecessary meetings disappear. Everyone focuses on what matters.

That intensity is not sustainable year-round. But in the right doses, it produces extraordinary results.

### Purpose Drives Engagement

The projects that I have found most fulfilling are not always the biggest or most prestigious. They are the ones where the outcome **matters** -- to the client, to the community, to the team.

The [Granville Diggers Club](/case-studies/granville-diggers-club-development) is a good example. It is an RSL club in Sydney's west, serving a local community that relies on it for social connection, events, and daily life. Delivering that project was not just a professional obligation -- it was a genuine contribution to the community.

That sense of purpose makes the demanding periods worthwhile.

### Teamwork Makes Intensity Sustainable

The difference between productive intensity and destructive overwork is the team. When you work with people who are competent, communicative, and committed, the hard phases feel manageable. When you are isolated, unsupported, or dealing with dysfunction, even a normal workload feels overwhelming.

Investing in team culture -- within your own firm and across the project team -- is not a luxury. It is a delivery strategy.

## What This Means for Our Industry

I am not arguing against work-life balance. I am arguing for a more honest conversation about what balance looks like in a project-based industry.

Some weeks are 40 hours. Some are 60. The question is not "how many hours?" but "is this intensity serving a purpose, and is it balanced over time?"

The best firms I have worked with -- architectural practices, builders, engineering consultancies -- understand this intuitively. They protect their people from unnecessary overwork, but they also create environments where purposeful intensity is valued and rewarded.

## A Personal Reflection

Building things is inherently demanding. It requires coordination, problem-solving, and the ability to manage complexity under pressure. That is part of what makes it rewarding.

I did not start Upscale PM to work less. I started it to work **better** -- to focus on projects that matter, with clients who value the relationship, and to build a practice that sustains its people while delivering exceptional outcomes.

That is what "beyond balance" means to me. Not the rejection of balance, but the pursuit of something richer -- meaning, purpose, and the satisfaction of seeing a project delivered well.
