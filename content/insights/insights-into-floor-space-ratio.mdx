## Why It's More Complex Than Just the Numbers

Walk past a small development site in Sydney and you will often hear people say, "Great, I will max out the FSR and push the height limit." It sounds logical -- after all, floor space ratio (FSR) is one of the key planning controls used by councils to determine how much building you can put on a site.

But here is the reality: what looks promising on paper rarely translates directly into an approval-ready scheme.

## What Is Floor Space Ratio?

FSR is the ratio of a building's total gross floor area (GFA) to the total area of the site. It is expressed as a number -- for example, an FSR of 2:1 means you can build up to twice the site area in gross floor area.

If your site is 500 sqm and the FSR is 2:1, your maximum GFA is 1,000 sqm.

Simple, right? Not quite.

## Why Maxing Out FSR Rarely Works

### 1. GFA Exclusions and Inclusions

Not all floor area counts toward FSR. Councils have specific rules about what is included and excluded:

- **Common areas** -- Lobbies, corridors, and lift shafts may or may not be included depending on the council's DCP
- **Basements** -- Typically excluded if used for parking, but included if used for habitable space
- **Balconies** -- Often excluded up to a certain percentage, then included beyond that threshold
- **Plant rooms** -- Usually excluded, but only up to a "reasonable" size

These rules vary between councils and can significantly affect the achievable floor area.

### 2. Building Envelope Constraints

FSR is only one control. The building envelope is also shaped by:

- **Height limits** -- You may have FSR capacity but not enough height to use it
- **Setbacks** -- Front, side, and rear setbacks reduce the building footprint
- **Solar access** -- Overshadowing controls can limit building height and depth
- **Privacy** -- Window placement and separation distances affect the floor plate

### 3. Design Quality and Amenity

Even if you can technically achieve the FSR, the resulting design may not be liveable, marketable, or approvable. Council design review panels look at:

- Natural light and ventilation to all habitable rooms
- Cross-ventilation and solar access
- Private open space and communal areas
- Visual privacy between units and neighbours
- Streetscape presentation and bulk/scale

A scheme that maximises FSR but delivers poor amenity will likely be refused by council -- or require costly redesign after lodgement.

## How to Approach FSR Strategically

1. **Start with a feasibility study** -- Understand the realistic yield before committing to a site. The maximum FSR is a ceiling, not a target.
2. **Test the building envelope early** -- Work with your architect to model the site constraints and see what the building envelope actually allows.
3. **Understand the council's priorities** -- Each council has different design expectations. Knowing what they value helps you design a scheme that gets through.
4. **Consider bonus FSR provisions** -- Some councils offer FSR bonuses for affordable housing contributions, design excellence, or heritage conservation. These can add significant value to a project.
5. **Get independent feasibility advice** -- A project manager or development manager can help you assess whether the numbers work before you invest heavily in design.
