## Rethinking Project Management: How Upscale PM Helps Clients Deliver with Confidence

*By Noel Yaxley, Founder of Upscale Project Management*

When I started **Upscale Project Management**, my goal was simple — to create a client-side project management company that genuinely serves people. I’d spent years delivering major developments across Sydney, watching projects succeed or stall depending not just on funding or design, but on how well they were managed day to day. I realised that with the right systems, structure, and communication, we could help clients deliver their visions more confidently and efficiently.

That’s what led me to establish Upscale PM — a **boutique, subscription-based project management service** that combines big-firm expertise with small-team agility.

### A New Model for a Changing Industry

The traditional model for project management often feels rigid. Clients are billed in lump sums, milestones, or percentages that don’t always reflect how modern developments unfold. I wanted to rethink that.

At Upscale, we offer a **subscription-based model** that spreads costs more evenly and transparently. Instead of large, unpredictable invoices, our clients pay manageable monthly fees. This creates continuity — they can keep us involved across multiple stages without the pressure of renegotiating each time.

It’s a new way of working that fits today’s environment, where flexibility, responsiveness, and trust matter just as much as technical capability.

### From Feasibility to Handover — Adding Value at Every Stage

Every project has its own story. Some developers come to us in the early days, when they’ve just found a site and need to know whether it’s worth pursuing. Others bring us in when approvals are delayed, or when construction is almost complete and defects are piling up.

Wherever the entry point, our goal is always the same — **to add clarity, direction, and value.**

**Early Feasibility**
When a client first identifies a potential site, we help them quickly assess whether the numbers stack up. We review planning controls, zoning, and yield potential, then prepare concise feasibility reports that give a realistic picture of what can be achieved. Years of experience working alongside town planners and architects mean we can identify opportunities that others might miss — whether a site is better suited to residential, commercial, or industrial use.

**Approvals and Authority Liaison**
Once a project moves into the development application phase, our role shifts to problem-solving. We work closely with planning consultants, architects, and councils to align expectations and secure approvals faster. It’s not uncommon for projects to be rejected initially, only to succeed after a few key adjustments — sometimes as simple as changing setbacks, managing overshadowing, or improving the public interface. Knowing what councils value helps us guide clients toward a supported, balanced outcome.

**Procurement and Delivery**
As projects enter procurement, we focus on maximising value. We help clients tender to trusted contractors who can deliver quality without inflating costs. Our approach is data-driven, competitive, and transparent — ensuring each tenderer understands scope, program, and deliverables before they price.

**Completion and Handover**
In the final stages, we manage the critical process of defects resolution and quality assurance. This is where projects can easily unravel — timelines are tight, and pressure mounts from all sides. Using **our own defect-tracking software**, we capture issues, photographs, and rectification progress, ensuring contractors meet the required standard before handover. The result is a smoother, more confident transition from construction to occupancy.

### Personal Relationships, Professional Systems

Being a **boutique agency** allows us to maintain genuine relationships with clients. Every project matters, and every client has direct access to me. Many become long-term collaborators — people who can pick up the phone on a weekend if something urgent comes up.

That personal connection doesn’t mean we lack structure. Quite the opposite. We’ve built strong internal systems for documentation, communication, and quality control. It’s that combination — personal service backed by process — that defines our approach.

Our agility also means we can move fast. We can take on a feasibility on Monday, have a site meeting on Wednesday, and a draft report by Friday. In a market where opportunities shift quickly, that responsiveness can make all the difference.

### Delivering More Than Projects

For me, project management isn’t just about buildings — it’s about **city-making**. Every project changes the urban fabric in some way, whether through housing, workplaces, or public amenities.

That’s what drives me: helping clients shape the city for the better. Whether it’s a mixed-use tower that brings life to a precinct, or an adaptive-reuse project that gives a site new purpose, there’s pride in seeing a vision become part of the skyline.

### Looking Ahead

The development landscape is evolving rapidly — tighter margins, higher expectations, and greater community scrutiny. In that environment, clarity, honesty, and agility aren’t optional; they’re essential.

At Upscale PM, we’re committed to staying small enough to stay personal, but structured enough to deliver large, complex projects with precision. Our focus remains where it started: **helping clients realise their visions, efficiently and responsibly.**
