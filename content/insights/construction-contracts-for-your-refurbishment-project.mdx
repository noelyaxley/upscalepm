## Choosing the Right Construction Contract for Your Refurbishment Project

Most refurbishment projects fail before they even start -- not because of poor design, but because the client picks the wrong delivery method. The type of construction contract you choose is one of the most important decisions you will make in a project. It sets the framework for how costs are managed, how risks are allocated, and how smoothly the job runs from start to finish.

## The Main Contract Types

### Traditional (Lump Sum) Contract

In a traditional contract, the design is fully documented by the client's consultants before the project is tendered. The contractor prices the completed design and delivers the works for a fixed price.

**Pros:**
- Price certainty (if the design is complete)
- Clear allocation of risk
- Client retains control over design quality

**Cons:**
- Requires fully documented design before tender
- Longer pre-construction phase
- Variations can be costly if design changes occur

### Design and Construct (D&C)

In a D&C contract, the contractor takes responsibility for both the design and the construction. The client provides a brief or concept design, and the contractor completes the detailed design and delivers the project.

**Pros:**
- Single point of responsibility
- Faster delivery (design and construction can overlap)
- Price certainty based on the brief

**Cons:**
- Client has less control over design detail
- Quality can suffer if the contractor value-engineers excessively
- Changes to the brief are expensive

### Construction Management

A construction manager coordinates the works, which are delivered through multiple trade packages. The client contracts directly with each trade.

**Pros:**
- Maximum flexibility
- Early works can start before design is complete
- Transparency on costs

**Cons:**
- No single point of accountability
- Client carries more risk
- Requires experienced client-side management

For most refurbishment projects under $10M, a **traditional lump sum contract** provides the best balance of price certainty and design control -- provided the documentation is thorough.

## Which Contract Is Right for Your Project?

The answer depends on several factors:

- **How complete is your design?** If it is 80%+ documented, a traditional contract works well. If you only have a concept, D&C may be more efficient.
- **How important is design quality?** If you need tight control over materials and finishes, traditional gives you more leverage.
- **What is your risk appetite?** D&C transfers more risk to the contractor. Traditional keeps more control (and responsibility) with the client.
- **What is your programme?** If speed is critical, D&C or construction management allows overlap between design and construction phases.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Going to tender with incomplete documentation** -- This is the single biggest cause of variations and budget blowouts in refurbishment projects.
2. **Choosing D&C to save time, then micromanaging the design** -- If you want design control, use a traditional contract.
3. **Not reading the contract conditions** -- Standard form contracts like the [MBA BC3](/insights/inside-the-mba-bc3-contract) or AS4902 contain important clauses on variations, delays, and disputes that every client should understand.
