# From Drawing Boards to Development: How a Career in Architecture Led to Project Management

Most career paths aren’t linear — they’re built project by project. For many architects, the move into project management isn’t always planned. Sometimes, it’s a natural evolution — one driven by the desire to solve bigger problems, lead cross-functional teams, and have a tangible impact on the built environment beyond just design.

That was the case for one project leader who started their career immersed in architecture and gradually moved toward managing large-scale developments. Their story reflects a growing trend in the industry: architects stepping into broader roles where leadership, communication, and coordination are just as important as design expertise.

## The Architecture Roots

Growing up in a household where both parents were architects, the decision to pursue architecture seemed inevitable. It was a path that felt familiar and fulfilling, with years spent studying the craft and gaining hands-on experience at some of Sydney’s leading architecture firms. But as projects became more complex and collaborative, something shifted.

“Over time, I realised that what I loved most wasn’t just designing buildings — it was solving problems across disciplines,” they explained. “I was naturally drawn to coordinating with engineers, consultants, and clients. That’s where I could really make a difference.”

This realisation sparked a pivot — one that led to the world of project management.

## First Steps into Project Leadership

The first significant project came in the form of a boutique residential development in Surry Hills: 18 high-end apartments on a tight 330-square-metre site. The project, known as **Calibre on Cooper Street**, was developed by Icon Oceania and came to the project manager just after the development application had been approved.

From that point on, they were responsible for leading the project through tender, construction, and handover.

“It was an intense learning curve,” they recalled. “One of the first skills I developed was understanding how to keep the momentum going. When you’re representing the developer, you become the driver of the entire process — you’re responsible for identifying roadblocks before they become delays.”

## The Realities of Coordinating Complexity

One of the biggest challenges on a project like this is coordination. With architects, planners, engineers, and consultants all contributing to the design and documentation, it’s easy for teams to fall into silos. That’s where a skilled project manager makes all the difference.

“In the early stages of design coordination, it's all about ensuring alignment between disciplines,” they said. “You might have a planner working to meet DA requirements, an engineer focusing on service layouts, and an architect trying to optimise spatial quality. It’s your job to bring those views together and make sure the output is cohesive — and buildable.”

This coordination isn’t just about smooth communication — it’s also about delivering value. On the Cooper Street site, space was at a premium. The team found creative ways to maximise Gross Floor Area (GFA) by rethinking the design of circulation spaces.

“By designing external lobby areas, we ensured they weren’t counted toward the GFA,” they explained. “That allowed us to allocate more space to the actual apartments, resulting in better living outcomes for future residents — and greater value for the developer.”

## Looking Back — and Forward

Years after project completion, returning to a site like Cooper Street offers a unique perspective.

“There’s a real sense of pride in walking through a project you helped deliver,” they said. “It’s a reminder that the work we do shapes the city around us — not just on paper, but in real, built outcomes.”

But perhaps more important is the motivation these experiences bring. Each completed project becomes a foundation for the next one, with new challenges, new collaborators, and new opportunities to improve.

## A Broader Perspective on Project Management

For professionals with architectural training, moving into project management offers a unique advantage. A deep understanding of design, planning, and compliance creates a strong foundation for leading development projects — particularly in the residential and mixed-use sectors.

“Having walked in the architect’s shoes, I know how to speak their language,” they said. “That makes me more effective when it comes to balancing design integrity with commercial outcomes.”

At **Upscale PM**, this blend of design understanding and project leadership is what sets the team apart. It's not just about delivering projects on time — it's about elevating the process, improving collaboration, and ultimately creating spaces that improve our cities.
