Australia’s push for **NSW housing supply** is increasingly colliding with the realities of constrained greenfield land, ageing infrastructure, and community expectations around amenity. In the Illawarra, those pressures are measurable: vacancy is sitting around **1.2% (Dec 2025)**, while Wollongong’s approvals track at roughly **2,500 dwellings per year versus ~4,000 needed**—a structural gap that pushes governments to back higher-density, transport-oriented infill.

That backdrop makes the **Corrimal Coke Works** redevelopment a telling case study. At **27 Railway Street, Corrimal (Wollongong LGA)**, the former **18.2ha** industrial site is being transformed into **The Works Corrimal**—a masterplanned community targeting **~850 homes**, well above the original ~550 concept, largely enabled by **Transport Oriented Development (TOD) uplifts under the Housing SEPP** and an accelerated SSD planning pathway.

Here’s what this project teaches developers and landowners about feasibility risk, sequencing, and delivery in real-world brownfield remediation.

## 1. Corrimal Coke Works: a TOD uplift that changes the entire feasibility

The headline for **Illawarra development** at Corrimal is yield. Project material for The Works Corrimal points to an ultimate yield of **about 850 homes** across the precinct, a step-change from earlier expectations and a clear example of how the **Housing SEPP’s TOD settings** can reshape a site’s value and staging logic. That matters because on complex industrial land, “more homes” isn’t just upside—it’s often what makes the remediation, heritage integration, and civil works bankable.

The planning and delivery stack is also instructive. The precinct was rezoned via a **Wollongong LEP amendment (gazetted April 2022)**, supported by a **site-specific DCP and Planning Agreement (December 2022)**—then progressed into SSD territory through the NSW housing acceleration environment (including the **Housing Delivery Authority** established December 2024). In other words: the feasibility doesn’t only live in the numbers; it lives in the pathway.

**Takeaway:** On brownfield land, treat TOD uplift as a feasibility lever—but only if your planning pathway and staging plan are aligned early enough to convert yield into fundable, consentable packages.

## 2. Stage 2A proves brownfield remediation is a delivery program, not a line item

Stage 2A of the Corrimal Coke Works redevelopment (SSD-83789711) is a practical snapshot of how **brownfield remediation** interacts with built form, affordability, and approvals. Declared State Significant Development in **June 2025**, it’s valued at **$96.6m**, proposing **207 apartments** across four buildings at **4–6 storeys** (approximately **14.8–21m** height) and **19,948sqm GFA** on a **12,905sqm** parcel. The scheme includes **252 basement car spaces**, deep soil zones, and communal open space—each of which has downstream implications for contamination validation, groundwater management, and construction methodology.

The affordable housing component is not tokenistic. Stage 2A includes **57 affordable dwellings (27%)**, exceeding the **35-unit minimum** in the Planning Agreement, with **Bridge Housing** to manage the apartments as a registered provider. That proportion can unlock SEPP bonuses, but it also adds delivery interfaces (CHP design standards, handover requirements, and operational considerations) that need to be managed like any other “client” within the project.

**Takeaway:** For brownfield SSDs, remediation and affordability aren’t separate workstreams—treat them as core delivery packages with clear scope boundaries, acceptance criteria, and program float.

## 3. Feasibility risk in the Illawarra: demand is real, but cashflow is tighter

The Corrimal case sits in a market with both pressure and constraint. On one hand, Illawarra fundamentals remain supportive: **Wollongong median unit prices reached ~$685k (Dec 2025, +6.5% YoY)**, and vacancy is around **1.2%**, indicating tight rental conditions. On the other hand, approvals lag demand (again, roughly **2,500 dwellings/year approved vs ~4,000 needed**), and financing conditions are not “easy-mode”—the RBA cash rate has been around **4.35% (Feb 2026)**, increasing the cost of carry and putting more scrutiny on pre-sales and delivery certainty.

What’s notable at Corrimal is the signal from Stage 1: **70% pre-sales** (predominantly one- and two-bedroom apartments) while Stage 1 is under construction. That doesn’t remove feasibility risk, but it does show that well-located TOD product can still clear in higher-rate conditions—particularly if the design, amenity, and pricing align to commuter and downsizer demand profiles.

**Takeaway:** In the current rate environment, the feasibility edge goes to projects that can prove buyer depth early—location near rail is powerful, but only when matched with an executable staging plan and credible delivery partner stack.

## 4. Brownfield remediation means managing the “unknown unknowns” (before they price you)

The Corrimal Coke Works site is heritage-listed (State Heritage Register, **May 2022**) and historically industrial—conditions that almost always amplify **feasibility risk**. The project has already required remediation, bulk earthworks, demolition, and contamination validation ahead of later-stage built form. That sequencing is not optional; it’s the difference between a controlled program and a reactive one.

From a project management perspective, there are three recurring traps on sites like this:

1. **Validation isn’t just paperwork**: it’s a construction constraint. It can dictate dig depth, stockpile handling, dewatering requirements, and when basements can start.
2. **Groundwater rebound after excavation** can change conditions quickly, even on sites that “passed” earlier investigations. If you don’t model it, you can be staring at major rework and extended monitoring—easily **$500k+** in unforeseen validation and treatment impacts on later stages.
3. **Rail adjacency** brings acoustic and vibration requirements that influence façade design, glazing, services penetrations, and even construction hours—especially when the site is targeting density through a TOD lens.

Construction cost pressure compounds these risks. For mid-rise apartments in the region, benchmarks of **$3,200–$3,600/sqm (Q4 2025)** mean any remediation surprises quickly flow into contingency, margin, or scope reductions.

**Takeaway:** Treat remediation and validation as a staged delivery program with measurable hold points—then budget for groundwater, not just soil, before you lock basement design and procurement.

## 5. Planning strategy is now a delivery strategy (especially under SSD + Housing SEPP)

Corrimal’s current pathway shows how planning settings can accelerate—or derail—delivery. Stage 2A sits within an SSD framework and uses TOD logic under the **Housing SEPP** to justify scale close to Corrimal Train Station. But the real lesson is that planning uplift creates its own delivery complexity: more GFA, more basement area, more interfaces, and more expectations around public benefit.

Heritage is a prime example. The precinct includes retained industrial elements (including chimneys) and a proposed Heritage Plaza. This can build identity and community support, but it also introduces constraints around curtilage, setbacks, and approvals coordination. One common developer mistake is underestimating how fast a heritage interface issue can become a program killer—particularly where building envelopes approach sensitive zones and require additional heritage justification or redesign.

Meanwhile, affordable housing delivery needs to be “designed in”, not “value-engineered in”. Stage 2A’s **27% affordable (57 units)** is a material component, and the handover partner (Bridge Housing) will expect compliance, durability, and maintainability. When that is resolved early, it can support uplift arguments and speed. When it’s left late, it can trigger redesign and procurement churn.

**Takeaway:** Under SSD and Housing SEPP settings, your approvals strategy must be built as a delivery strategy—lock heritage interfaces and CHP requirements early to protect program and procurement.

## Conclusion

So what’s the delivery reality behind the Corrimal Coke Works story—**850 homes plus remediation**? It’s proof that TOD policy can unlock major yield on constrained sites, but only developers who treat brownfield remediation as a first-class project (with sequencing, governance, and validation discipline) will convert that uplift into completed dwellings. The Works Corrimal is not just a planning win; it’s a program-management exercise across contamination, heritage, rail interface, affordability, and market timing.

For developers and landowners assessing **Corrimal Coke Works**–style opportunities, the central question isn’t “can we get the uplift?” It’s “can we stage, de-risk, and fund the uplift through to completion?” In the Illawarra—where vacancy is about **1.2%** and approvals trail demand—projects that execute well will be the ones that genuinely contribute to **NSW housing supply**, not just the pipeline.

- **Plan remediation like construction**, with hold points, acceptance criteria, and groundwater contingency.  
- **Use Housing SEPP uplift strategically**, but model the delivery complexity it creates (basements, services, heritage interfaces).  
- **Secure CHP and heritage pathways early**, so affordability and character become feasibility positives—not redesign triggers.
