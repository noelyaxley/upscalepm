## What Is Client-Side Project Management?

When people hear the term **project management**, they often think of a broad skill set that applies across many industries. From IT to marketing, manufacturing to healthcare, project managers keep things moving, solve problems, and ensure outcomes are delivered.

But in property and construction, the role of a client-side project manager (PM) is both unique and critical.

## The Difference Between Client-Side and Contractor-Side

Unlike a builder's project manager, who represents the contractor's interests, a **client-side project manager** works exclusively for the client -- the property owner, developer, or organisation commissioning the project.

This distinction matters because the contractor's PM is focused on delivering the project within the contractor's budget and programme. The client's PM is focused on delivering the project within the **client's** budget and programme -- and protecting the client's interests throughout.

The contractor's PM works for the contractor. The client's PM works for **you**. Without client-side representation, there is no one at the table whose sole focus is your outcome.

## What Does a Client-Side PM Do?

A client-side project manager is involved across the full project lifecycle:

### Pre-Construction
- Feasibility assessment and budget development
- Consultant procurement and coordination
- Design management and review
- Authority approvals (DA, CDC, CC)
- Tender preparation and contractor selection

### Construction
- Contract administration
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Cost management and variation assessment
- Quality assurance and site inspections
- Programme tracking and delay management

### Post-Construction
- Practical completion assessment
- Defects management
- Final account negotiation
- Handover coordination

## Why Do You Need One?

Most property owners and developers engage a client-side PM for one or more of these reasons:

1. **They do not have the in-house expertise** -- Property development is complex. Without construction knowledge, clients are at a disadvantage when dealing with builders, consultants, and councils.

2. **They want an independent voice** -- The architect designs, the QS costs, the builder builds. But who coordinates all of them and ensures they are all working toward the client's goals? That is the PM.

3. **They want to protect their investment** -- Construction projects involve significant capital. A PM helps avoid the cost overruns, delays, and quality issues that erode returns.

4. **They do not have the time** -- Managing a construction project is a full-time job. Most clients have other businesses and commitments. A PM handles the day-to-day so the client does not have to.

## Choosing the Right PM

Not all project managers are equal. When selecting a client-side PM, look for:

- **Industry experience** -- Have they delivered similar projects? Do they understand your sector?
- **Independence** -- Are they truly independent, or do they have relationships with builders or consultants that could create conflicts?
- **Communication style** -- You want a PM who communicates clearly, directly, and regularly.
- **Commercial acumen** -- A good PM understands budgets, contracts, and risk.
- **References** -- Talk to previous clients. Ask about outcomes, not just process.
