# Sydney Development Project Management: Lessons from Barangaroo

Sydney's development pipeline demands precision: faster delivery, tighter sustainability expectations, and higher construction risk. Barangaroo shows what it takes.

## 1. Governance First

Precinct projects amplify every risk. The first lesson from Barangaroo is that governance protects feasibility and program. Developers need a clearly defined client brief, decision rights, change control, and a single source of truth for program, cost plan, and risk.

When governance is weak, scope and stakeholder demands tend to grow faster than the project team's ability to respond.

## 2. Staging as Commercial Strategy

In dense precincts, access, logistics, noise and vibration controls, temp services and public realm interfaces often become the real critical path—not your ideal Gantt chart. Model staging early against approvals pathways and funding triggers, then lock it into consultant scopes and procurement planning.

## 3. Procurement Aligned to Risk

If risk cannot be clearly defined, it cannot be fairly priced or managed. The grey zones—facade vs services vs public domain—are where disputes breed. Choose contracts that match the real risk profile.

## 4. Stakeholder Management is Delivery Management

In Sydney, stakeholder management is delivery management. Treat it like a critical-path system with owners and due dates. Run an issue register with owners, due dates, and escalation pathways. Lock consultation milestones into the program.

## 5. Interfaces and Accountability

A single source of truth for program, cost plan and risk is essential. When multiple delivery packages move at once, interface management becomes the mechanism that prevents claims and delays.
