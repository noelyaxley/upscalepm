## Understanding Ground Anchors and Licence Access Deeds in Sydney Developments

Deep basement excavations are a hallmark of modern Sydney construction. Whether it is a new apartment building, a commercial tower, or a mixed-use project, sites are often tight and developers need to dig several levels below ground. To do this safely, they rely on **ground anchors** -- a critical but often misunderstood element of construction.

Yet ground anchors do not just raise engineering questions. They raise legal ones too.

## What Are Ground Anchors?

Ground anchors (also called rock anchors or tie-back anchors) are structural elements drilled through the excavation face into the surrounding rock or soil. They provide lateral support to the shoring system, preventing the walls of the excavation from collapsing inward.

In Sydney's sandstone geology, ground anchors are commonly used because:

- Sites are often constrained, with buildings on all sides
- Basement excavations can extend 3 to 5 levels below ground
- The rock provides good anchorage for tensioned cables or bars

The challenge is that these anchors extend **beyond the site boundary** -- into the neighbouring property's rock.

<Callout type="warning">
Ground anchors that extend under a neighbouring property require the neighbour's consent. Without it, you could face legal action, delays, or an injunction to stop work.

## What Is a Licence Access Deed?

A Licence Access Deed (LAD) is a legal agreement between the developer and the neighbouring property owner that grants permission for ground anchors to be installed under the neighbour's land.

The deed typically covers:

- **Scope of work** -- What will be installed, at what depth, and for how long
- **Licence fee** -- Compensation to the neighbour for the use of their subsurface
- **Insurance requirements** -- The developer must maintain adequate insurance throughout the works
- **Reinstatement obligations** -- What happens to the anchors after the project is complete (they are usually de-stressed and left in place)
- **Damage provisions** -- Who pays if the neighbour's property is damaged during installation
- **Duration** -- How long the licence remains in effect

## How Are Licence Fees Determined?

Licence fees vary significantly depending on:

- The number of anchors
- The depth and extent of encroachment
- The location and value of the neighbouring property
- Market precedent in the area
- Negotiation leverage

In Sydney, fees can range from a few thousand dollars per anchor to significantly more for premium locations. Some neighbours negotiate a lump sum; others seek annual payments.

## Common Issues and Disputes

### Refusing Access

Neighbours have the right to refuse access. In some cases, this forces the developer to redesign the shoring system -- using alternatives like soldier piles, contiguous piles, or internal bracing. These alternatives are typically more expensive and can add time to the programme.

### Damage Claims

Vibration from drilling, ground movement, and dewatering can all cause damage to neighbouring properties. Pre-condition surveys (dilapidation reports) conducted before work commences are essential for documenting existing conditions.

### Legacy Anchors

Ground anchors are rarely removed after construction. They remain in the rock indefinitely. This can become an issue if the neighbouring property wants to excavate in the future -- they may encounter abandoned anchors that are difficult and costly to remove.
