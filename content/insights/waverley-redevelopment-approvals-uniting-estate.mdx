## Introduction

Across NSW, seniors housing has moved from “nice-to-have” to essential city-shaping infrastructure. The pressure is demographic and immediate: **the over-75 population is the fastest-growing age group in NSW**, yet **seniors housing remains significantly undersupplied across the state**—a mismatch now influencing planning decisions and state policy settings.

That backdrop explains why the **Uniting Waverley Estate redevelopment** at **125 Birrell Street, Waverley** (next to Bondi Junction) matters well beyond the eastern suburbs. Approved in **February 2026** via the **State Significant Development Application (SSDA)** pathway, the **$500 million** transformation of the **3.4-hectare** estate will deliver **231 independent living apartments (including 23 affordable units)**, **105 residential aged-care places**, and keep the **War Memorial Hospital operational**—all within a staged construction program across a constrained, heritage-sensitive site.

Here’s what the Waverley redevelopment teaches developers about approvals strategy, stakeholder management, and building on operational land.

## 1. Treat the SSDA pathway as a strategy, not a formality (Waverley redevelopment)

The most important “hidden” lesson in the **Waverley redevelopment** is that approvals success was engineered over time, not won in a single determination. The project reportedly travelled a **nine-year approval pathway**, which is increasingly normal for complex, high-value sites where heritage, neighbours, and operational constraints collide.

Waverley’s scale—**$500 million** and **seven buildings (four to seven storeys)**—made the **SSDA pathway** a practical necessity. But it also became a commercial advantage: SSDA assessment is inherently state-led, and **state policy tailwinds for seniors housing** helped carry the project through contested issues (affordable housing, trees, construction disruption) that would often derail a standard local DA.

Uniting’s narrative was framed around public benefit, independence, and broader housing supply impacts:

> "The over-75 population is the fastest-growing age group in NSW, yet seniors housing remains significantly undersupplied across the state. This accommodation helps older people stay independent for longer, delays the need for higher-level care, and frees up family homes for others during a housing crisis."  
> - Tracey Burton, Chief Executive, Uniting NSW.ACT

**Takeaway:** If you’re pursuing a major seniors, health, or precinct-style project, build your DA strategy around **state priorities and measurable public benefit**, and budget for a multi-year pathway (including redesign cycles) as a baseline assumption.

## 2. Lock in operational continuity early—or your staging will run the project

Projects like Uniting Waverley are not “build vacant, then operate”. They’re **operate-while-building**. The approval retained the operational **War Memorial Hospital** and existing health services, meaning construction staging is not a scheduling exercise—it’s a risk system that governs safety, access, noise, services continuity, and reputation.

That complexity compounds because Waverley isn’t a simple retirement village. It’s a mixed, integrated precinct delivering **231 independent living apartments plus 105 aged-care places** (336 total accommodation outcomes), with community uses and open space. Using the benchmark in the brief, the project sits at roughly **$1.49 million per unit** ($500M ÷ 336), reflecting eastern suburbs costs plus the premium of working around a live hospital and heritage fabric.

This is where stakeholder management becomes practical, not theoretical: hospital operations, clinicians, residents, visitors, emergency access, and service contractors must all be incorporated into the construction methodology and the communications plan.

> "Enhanced community services and facilities, increased green spaces available to residents and the community, and landscaped sensory gardens are all part of the newly-approved $500 million redevelopment of the Uniting Waverley Estate."  
> - Simon Furness, Director of Property and Housing, Uniting NSW.ACT

**Takeaway:** For operational sites, develop a **staging masterplan** before detailed design is “finished”: decanting/temporary works, infection control (where relevant), access routes, and service cutover plans must be priced, documented, and stakeholder-tested early.

## 3. Use heritage as approval leverage—but manage the cost reality (Sydney eastern suburbs planning)

Sydney eastern suburbs planning is unforgiving on bulk, scale, and neighbourhood character—particularly where heritage streetscapes and established communities meet mid-rise density. Waverley’s scheme handled this by pairing contemporary form with a conservation story: **four heritage-listed cottages retained and restored**, with design by **Architectus** and **Welsh + Major**, and landscape architecture by **Arcadia**.

This approach does two things at once. First, it creates an approvals narrative around adaptive reuse and continuity of place. Second, it gives stakeholders something tangible to support—even if they oppose other elements like height or construction impacts.

Uniting put the design intent plainly:

> "The seven buildings each balance heritage sensitivity with contemporary form."  
> - Tracey Burton, Chief Executive, Uniting NSW.ACT

The commercial catch is that heritage is rarely “free goodwill”. Retention and restoration can add programme time, latent conditions risk, and cost uplift—especially when paired with staged construction. That’s one reason why feasibility for seniors housing can vary dramatically: the brief compares Waverley (~**$1.49M/unit**) to Uniting’s Belrose approval (~**$750K/unit**), illustrating how location, heritage, and integration shift the cost base.

**Takeaway:** Treat heritage retention as a **dual-track workstream**—(1) approvals value and (2) delivery risk. Price it transparently in feasibility, and use early contractor/heritage consultant input to reduce latent-condition surprises.

## 4. Don’t “add” affordable housing at the end—bake it into yield logic (Waverley redevelopment)

Affordable housing is now a baseline expectation in many NSW approval environments, particularly for large precinct-scale proposals. At Waverley, the project includes **23 affordable housing units** (within **231 independent living apartments**), which triggered stakeholder debate not just about the percentage—but about the **method of calculation** (unit count versus Gross Floor Area).

That distinction matters because it influences design efficiency, apartment mix, and financial outcomes. Stakeholders framed the issue as both local need and “community compensation” for construction impacts on a tight site:

> "Our major objection relates to affordable housing and the need for more accessible and affordable units to serve Waverley's aging population. Unfortunately Uniting is only offering 10% however we believe this is insufficient given the lack of affordable housing and poor 'community compensation' for the impact of the build on a constrained site."  
> - Community Submission, NSW Planning Portal

From a developer’s perspective, the practical lesson is that affordability debates can be predictable—and therefore pre-managed. You need a clear affordability position tied to: eligibility, allocation/management model, dwelling typologies, and how it integrates with seniors living operations.

**Takeaway:** In your development approvals strategy, define affordable housing early (including whether it’s **GFA-based or unit-based**) and align it with the operating model—because stakeholder scrutiny will test the numbers, not the intent.

## 5. Expect environmental objections—respond with measurable trade-offs (stakeholder management)

On constrained urban sites, “green” issues are rarely abstract. Waverley attracted concern about the planned removal of **95 trees**, even as Uniting committed to a **net-positive green space** outcome and expanded communal landscape features (sensory gardens, courtyards, intergenerational elements).

This is where stakeholder management needs to move from reassurance to evidence. Environmental stakeholders (and increasingly, consent authorities) will look for clear documentation: tree audit methodology, retention rationale, replacement ratios, canopy targets, deep soil zones, and how landscape performance is protected during staged construction.

Crucially, in a live precinct—particularly one supporting older residents and health services—landscape isn’t just aesthetic. It’s thermal comfort, access, wellbeing, and a key contributor to social licence during a multi-year build. With construction expected to run around **four years**, the way you sequence landscaping and public realm delivery can materially shape sentiment across the program.

Uniting’s emphasis on enhanced shared spaces speaks directly to this:

> "Enhanced community services and facilities, increased green spaces available to residents and the community, and landscaped sensory gardens are all part of the newly-approved $500 million redevelopment of the Uniting Waverley Estate."  
> - Simon Furness, Director of Property and Housing, Uniting NSW.ACT

**Takeaway:** Convert environmental objections into a quantified package: publish canopy outcomes, replacement commitments, and staged landscape delivery—then keep reporting consistent during construction to protect trust.

## Conclusion

So, what does the Uniting Waverley Estate story tell us about uniting approvals and stakeholder complexity in Sydney’s eastern suburbs? It shows that success is less about “winning” individual objections and more about building a development narrative that aligns with state priorities—then executing with credible staging, measurable community benefit, and disciplined stakeholder management.

The **Waverley redevelopment** also reinforces a market reality: seniors housing is being assessed and supported like critical infrastructure. When the project can demonstrate need (fast-growing over-75 cohort), outcomes (**231 apartments + 105 aged-care places**), and operational continuity (hospital stays open), the approval pathway becomes more achievable—even on a heritage-sensitive, highly scrutinised site.

Key developer takeaways:
- **Plan for time:** complex sites can take **years** (Waverley: **nine-year pathway**)—structure funding, governance, and consultant scopes accordingly.  
- **Stage around operations:** live-site continuity should drive programme logic, budget, and risk registers—not sit in an appendix.  
- **Quantify trade-offs:** affordability, trees, and public benefit need transparent numbers, not slogans.

If you’re considering a seniors, health, or mixed-use precinct in NSW, the next step is turning these lessons into a practical approvals and delivery plan.
