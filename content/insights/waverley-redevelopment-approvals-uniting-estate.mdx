# What Uniting Waverley Estate Teaches Developers About Getting Big Approvals Over the Line

Seniors housing in NSW has gone from niche to nation-building. The **over-75 population is the fastest-growing age group in the state**, yet supply hasn't come close to keeping up — and that mismatch is now actively shaping planning policy and consent decisions at the state level.

Which is why the **Uniting Waverley Estate** redevelopment at **125 Birrell Street, Waverley** — right next to Bondi Junction — is worth paying attention to, whether you're in the eastern suburbs or not.

Approved in **February 2026** via the **State Significant Development Application (SSDA)** pathway, this is a **$500 million** transformation of a **3.4-hectare** estate delivering **231 independent living apartments** (including **23 affordable units**), **105 residential aged-care places**, and keeping the **War Memorial Hospital running** throughout construction. Seven buildings, four to seven storeys, staged across a constrained, heritage-sensitive site with a live hospital in the middle.

Here's what Waverley teaches us about approvals strategy, stakeholder management, and building on operational land.

---

## 1. Treat the SSDA pathway as a strategy, not a formality

The biggest lesson from Waverley is that this approval was engineered over time — not won in a single determination. The project reportedly took a **nine-year pathway** from inception to consent. That's increasingly normal for complex, high-value sites where heritage, neighbours, and operational constraints all collide.

At **$500 million** across **seven buildings**, the SSDA pathway was a practical necessity. But it also became a commercial advantage. SSDA assessment is state-led, and the **policy tailwinds for seniors housing** helped carry the project through issues — affordable housing percentages, tree removal, construction disruption — that would typically derail a standard local DA at Waverley Council.

Uniting framed the whole narrative around public benefit:

> "This accommodation helps older people stay independent for longer, delays the need for higher-level care, and frees up family homes for others during a housing crisis."
> — Tracey Burton, Chief Executive, Uniting NSW.ACT

That framing matters. When your project aligns with state priorities — housing supply, ageing population, critical infrastructure — the consent authority has a reason to push through contested issues rather than refuse on the path of least resistance.

**Bottom line:** If you're pursuing a major seniors, health, or precinct-scale project, build your DA strategy around **state priorities and measurable public benefit**. And budget for a multi-year pathway as a baseline assumption — not a worst case.

## 2. Lock in operational continuity early — or staging will run your project

This isn't a "build vacant, then operate" project. It's **operate-while-building**. The approval retained the **War Memorial Hospital** and existing health services, which means construction staging isn't just a scheduling exercise — it's a risk system that governs safety, access, noise, services continuity, and reputation.

That complexity compounds because Waverley isn't a simple retirement village. It's a mixed, integrated precinct delivering **336 total accommodation outcomes** (231 ILUs + 105 aged-care places), plus community uses and open space. At roughly **$1.49 million per unit** ($500M / 336), that reflects eastern suburbs land costs plus the significant premium of working around a live hospital and heritage fabric.

This is where stakeholder management goes from theoretical to deeply practical: hospital operations, clinicians, existing residents, visitors, emergency vehicle access, and service contractors all need to be built into the construction methodology and the comms plan. Miss one of those and you've got an ambulance blocked by a concrete truck on the front page of the Wentworth Courier.

> "Enhanced community services and facilities, increased green spaces available to residents and the community, and landscaped sensory gardens are all part of the newly-approved $500 million redevelopment."
> — Simon Furness, Director of Property and Housing, Uniting NSW.ACT

**Bottom line:** For operational sites, develop a **staging masterplan** before detailed design is locked in. Decanting, temporary works, infection control, access routes, and service cutover plans all need to be priced, documented, and tested with stakeholders early — not bolted on at CC stage.

## 3. Heritage is powerful approval leverage — but manage the cost reality

The eastern suburbs planning environment is unforgiving on bulk, scale, and neighbourhood character — especially where heritage streetscapes and established communities meet mid-rise density. Waverley's scheme handled this by pairing contemporary form with a genuine conservation story: **four heritage-listed cottages retained and restored**, designed by **Architectus** and **Welsh + Major**, with landscape architecture by **Arcadia**.

This does two things at once. First, it creates an approvals narrative around adaptive reuse and continuity of place — giving the assessment panel something positive to anchor to. Second, it gives community stakeholders something tangible to support, even if they're opposing other elements like height or construction impacts.

> "The seven buildings each balance heritage sensitivity with contemporary form."
> — Tracey Burton, Chief Executive, Uniting NSW.ACT

The commercial catch? Heritage is rarely free goodwill. Retention and restoration add programme time, latent conditions risk, and cost uplift — particularly when layered on top of staged construction around a live hospital. That's exactly why feasibility for seniors housing varies so dramatically: Waverley comes in at roughly **~$1.49M/unit** compared to Uniting's Belrose approval at **~$750K/unit**. Location, heritage, and integration complexity roughly double the cost base.

**Bottom line:** Treat heritage retention as a **dual-track workstream** — (1) approvals leverage and (2) delivery risk. Price it transparently in feasibility, and get early contractor and heritage consultant input to flush out latent-condition surprises before you're locked into a program.

## 4. Don't bolt affordable housing on at the end — bake it into yield logic

Affordable housing is now a baseline expectation in most NSW approval environments for large precinct-scale proposals. At Waverley, the project includes **23 affordable housing units** within the 231 ILUs, which triggered stakeholder debate not just about the percentage — but about the **method of calculation**: unit count versus Gross Floor Area.

That distinction matters because it directly influences design efficiency, apartment mix, and financial outcomes. The community wasn't shy about it either:

> "Our major objection relates to affordable housing and the need for more accessible and affordable units to serve Waverley's aging population. Unfortunately Uniting is only offering 10% however we believe this is insufficient given the lack of affordable housing and poor 'community compensation' for the impact of the build on a constrained site."
> — Community Submission, NSW Planning Portal

From a developer's perspective, the practical lesson is that affordability debates are largely predictable — and therefore pre-manageable. You need a clear position tied to: eligibility criteria, allocation and management model, dwelling typologies, and how it integrates with the operating model. If you leave the affordable housing conversation to the exhibition period, you'll spend the rest of the approval defending a number someone else chose for you.

**Bottom line:** Define your affordable housing position early — including whether it's **GFA-based or unit-based** — and align it with the operating model. Stakeholder scrutiny will test the numbers, not the intent.

## 5. Expect environmental objections — respond with measurable trade-offs

On constrained urban sites, "green" issues are never abstract. Waverley attracted significant concern about the planned removal of **95 trees**, even as Uniting committed to a **net-positive green space** outcome with expanded communal landscapes — sensory gardens, courtyards, and intergenerational spaces.

This is where stakeholder management needs to shift from reassurance to hard evidence. Environmental stakeholders — and increasingly, consent authorities — want clear documentation: tree audit methodology, retention rationale, replacement ratios, canopy cover targets, deep soil zones, and how landscape outcomes are protected during staged construction.

On a live precinct supporting older residents and health services, landscape isn't just aesthetic. It's thermal comfort, wayfinding, wellbeing, and a key contributor to social licence during a **four-year construction program**. The way you sequence landscaping and public realm delivery can materially shape community sentiment across the whole build.

**Bottom line:** Convert environmental objections into a quantified package — publish canopy outcomes, replacement commitments, and staged landscape delivery milestones. Then keep reporting consistently during construction to protect trust.

## Wrapping up

The Uniting Waverley Estate story shows that getting big approvals over the line in the eastern suburbs isn't about "winning" individual objections. It's about building a development narrative that aligns with state priorities — then executing with credible staging, measurable community benefit, and disciplined stakeholder management across the full approval and delivery timeline.

It also reinforces a market reality: seniors housing is now being assessed and supported like critical infrastructure. When a project can demonstrate genuine need (fast-growing over-75 cohort), tangible outcomes (**231 apartments + 105 aged-care places**), and operational continuity (the hospital stays open), the approval pathway becomes achievable — even on a heritage-sensitive, heavily scrutinised site.

If you're working on a similar project, the key takeaways:

- **Plan for time:** complex sites can take **years** — Waverley took **nine**. Structure funding, governance, and consultant scopes accordingly.
- **Stage around operations:** live-site continuity should drive programme logic, budget, and risk registers — not sit in an appendix.
- **Quantify trade-offs:** affordability, trees, and public benefit need transparent numbers, not slogans.
