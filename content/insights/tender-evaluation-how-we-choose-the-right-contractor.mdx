## It's Not Always the Lowest Price

So, do you just pick the lowest tender and go for it?

It's a question I get asked all the time -- and the short answer is **no**. Tender evaluation is about a lot more than price. It's about risk, capability, compliance, and value.

Earlier this month, we received all the tenders for the [Granville Diggers Club](/case-studies/granville-diggers-club-development) -- an internal fit-out of an RSL club in Sydney's west. Going through the submissions was a reminder of just how important this stage is.

## What Goes Into a Tender Evaluation?

When tenders come in, we assess them across multiple criteria. Price is one factor, but it sits alongside:

- **Compliance** -- Did the tenderer follow the instructions? Are all required documents included? Non-compliant submissions signal risk before you even look at the numbers.
- **Methodology** -- How does the contractor plan to deliver? What is their approach to staging, sequencing, and risk management?
- **Experience and capability** -- Have they done similar projects? Do they have the team, resources, and track record?
- **Programme** -- Can they meet the required timeframes? Is their programme realistic or overly optimistic?
- **Price breakdown** -- Not just the total, but how the pricing is structured. Are there gaps, exclusions, or provisional sums that could blow out?

The cheapest tender is not always the best value. A low price with significant exclusions or an unrealistic programme can cost far more in the long run.

## How We Score Tenders

We use a weighted scoring matrix that balances price against non-price criteria. Typically:

- **Price:** 40-50% weighting
- **Methodology and programme:** 20-25%
- **Experience and capability:** 15-20%
- **Compliance and risk:** 10-15%

Each tender is scored independently, then the results are compared. We prepare a tender evaluation report for the client that clearly explains the scoring, highlights risks, and makes a recommendation.

## Common Pitfalls in Tender Evaluation

### Chasing the Lowest Number

A tender that is significantly cheaper than the rest should raise questions, not celebrations. Why is it so much lower? What have they excluded? Are they desperate for work -- and will they cut corners to make it work?

### Ignoring Non-Price Factors

A contractor who is $50,000 more expensive but has a proven track record, a realistic programme, and strong references may save you far more than $50,000 in avoided variations, delays, and disputes.

### Not Checking References

Always call referees. Ask about the contractor's communication, their approach to variations, their quality of work, and whether the project came in on time and on budget.

## Why This Matters

The contractor you select will be your delivery partner for the next 6 to 18 months. Getting this decision wrong can cost time, money, and significant stress. Getting it right sets the project up for success.
