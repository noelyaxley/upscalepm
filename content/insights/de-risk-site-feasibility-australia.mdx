# De-risk Site Feasibility: Lessons from Topic Selection, Australia

![Flowchart showing systematic topic selection: broad area → sources → techniques → refinement.](https://ebsedu.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/topic-selection-process.png)

Australia’s development pipeline is getting less forgiving: tighter planning settings, higher holding costs, and a bigger premium on getting feasibility right early. In academic research, the same pressure exists—choose the wrong topic and you waste months chasing data that doesn’t exist, or duplicating work that’s already been done. Educational frameworks now consistently push a systematic approach, because the fastest way to fail is to start with a vague idea and hope clarity appears later.

This article uses a “project” that isn’t a building, but should feel familiar to any developer: the **Methodological Framework for Topic Selection** used across universities globally (for theses, systematic reviews, and policy research). Its tools—**analogy, relevance trees, and morphological analysis**—mirror what the best developers do in site acquisition, DA strategy, and early design management: break ambiguity into decisions you can test.

Here’s what property developers, investors, and landowners can borrow—immediately.

## 1. Treat site feasibility like topic selection: start broad, then narrow fast

The first discipline in research topic selection is to identify a broad area, scan what exists, then tighten the scope until it’s **specific, testable, and deliverable**. The same sequence applies to development feasibility: if your “topic” is too broad (e.g., “mixed-use near a station”), you’ll burn time and fees before you’ve even proven the core proposition.

One of the most practical research frameworks highlights three idea-generation techniques: **analogy, relevance trees, and morphological analysis**—a structured way to create options without losing control of scope. In feasibility terms, a relevance tree is how you stop a project becoming everything to everyone: you decompose the opportunity into zoning, massing, access, services, market depth, funding constraints, staging, and delivery risk.

For developers, this is the difference between “we can probably get something up” and “we know the controlling constraints and the highest-value compliant outcome.” It also prevents the most expensive kind of redesign: the one caused by discovering a fatal constraint late.

**Takeaway:** Build a feasibility “relevance tree” before you spend on concept polish—decompose the site into constraints and value drivers, then choose the tightest viable pathway.

## 2. Make “policy relevance” your planning strategy, not an afterthought

Academic guidance increasingly ranks **policy relevance** as a core filter in topic selection, alongside whether a gap exists and whether the work can be supported by data. In development, “policy relevance” is your alignment with the planning scheme intent: strategic centres, housing targets, design guides, place plans, flood controls, biodiversity overlays, and infrastructure servicing realities.

One research source summarises **six aspects** used to select a strong topic: **research gap, policy relevance, data availability, clarity of relationships, researcher interest, and subject focus**. Translate that directly into a DA reality check:

- *Gap:* What does the local market actually need (product, price point, absorption)?  
- *Policy relevance:* What does Council/state planning want here—and what do they resist?  
- *Data availability:* Can you prove assumptions (traffic, flooding, contamination, wind, solar access)?  
- *Clarity of relationships:* Does the design logic stack up (yield vs amenity vs cost vs risk)?  
- *Interest:* Do you have sponsor conviction (capital partners, pre-commitment logic)?  
- *Focus:* Can the team execute without scope creep?

> - Risingscholars.net, Topic selection criteria

Policy-aligned projects still face negotiation, but they start from a defensible base. Misaligned projects may win occasionally—but they carry higher time and holding-cost risk.

**Takeaway:** Run a “six-aspect” feasibility screen early—especially policy relevance and data availability—before you lock in massing or go to market.

## 3. Do a data audit before you fall in love with the concept (or the site)

In research, overly broad topics fail because they can’t be evidenced—there’s not enough accessible data, or the question can’t be answered with the tools available. In property development, the parallel failure is committing to a site (or a yield) before verifying the site’s constraints and the evidence required for approval.

Research guidance is blunt: the process is iterative and typically refined through supervisor feedback. In development, your “supervisors” are your planners, architects, traffic engineers, services consultants, and—critically—your builder and QS. If the early advisory loop is missing, the project becomes a speculation instead of a managed investment.

The research brief’s most useful reminder for developers is the emphasis on **data availability** as a selection criterion. In our world that means: can you actually obtain (and afford) the information needed to support the DA and de-risk construction? Examples include:

- Flood and overland flow modelling requirements  
- Acid sulphate soils risk  
- Geotech and rock impacts on basement cost  
- Utility upgrades and lead times  
- Heritage significance and view-sharing impacts

> "The first step in the research process is to choose an interesting topic and create a research question."  
> - Polk State College LibGuides, Research basics

The development equivalent is: define the *approval question* early. “What is the highest and best compliant outcome, and what evidence will Council require to support it?”

**Takeaway:** Treat due diligence like a research data audit—if you can’t source the evidence, you can’t defend the yield.

## 4. Use structured optioning tools to avoid DA “scope creep”

Good researchers don’t just pick a topic—they use frameworks to generate and test options systematically. The same discipline is what prevents DA scope creep: endless redesign loops, shifting briefs, and consultant rework that inflates soft costs and erodes program certainty.

The research methodology toolkit highlights structured techniques (again: analogy, relevance trees, morphological analysis). In development, morphological analysis looks like a controlled options matrix:

- Planning pathway options (CDC vs DA; staged approvals; modifications)  
- Typology options (walk-up, mid-rise, mixed-use, build-to-rent)  
- Basement/no-basement and servicing strategies  
- Construction methodology constraints and cost movements  
- Staging strategies to suit funding and market absorption

One of UpScale PM’s most consistent observations is that projects drift when optioning isn’t bounded by decision gates. Research methodology solves this with refinement cycles—each pass narrows the topic until it’s feasible. Development should do the same: set gates where you either (1) proceed, (2) pivot, or (3) stop.

> - Columbia Southern University LibGuides, Selecting a research topic

You don’t need more options—you need the right options, tested against constraints and delivery reality.

**Takeaway:** Replace “design churn” with gated optioning—matrix the few viable pathways, stress-test them, then lock the brief.

## 5. Title discipline = investor discipline: sharpen the story and the scope

In academic work, the title is not decoration—it’s a commitment device. It forces clarity: what you’re actually doing, for whom, and why it matters. Development is no different. If you can’t articulate the project in a crisp, testable “title”, you’re likely carrying hidden ambiguity in planning risk, product definition, or delivery strategy.

One source notes that question-style titles can quickly catch attention—useful in abstracts. Developers can adopt the same tactic for internal briefs and investment decks: frame the project as a question your feasibility must answer. For example:

- “Can this site deliver X dwellings within Y height and Z parking outcome—without a basement?”  
- “What is the highest-value compliant massing that avoids triggered studies?”

> "Titles that ask questions are well-suited to abstracts... catch the reader’s attention quickly."  
> - Ref-N-Write, Writing catchy research paper titles

The research brief also flags an often-missed control: **subject focus**. In development, that’s the discipline to prioritise what moves the approval and delivery outcome—not what’s merely interesting. A sharper brief improves consultant outputs, reduces redesign, and accelerates decisions.

**Takeaway:** Write a “project title” that constrains scope—if it can’t be stated clearly in one sentence, feasibility isn’t done.

## Conclusion

The central question is whether developers can meaningfully improve project outcomes by borrowing “topic selection” discipline from research. In practice, yes: the same systematic tools that prevent months of wasted academic effort can prevent expensive redesign, misaligned DAs, and feasibility models built on untested assumptions.

The Methodological Framework for Topic Selection is a reminder that successful outcomes are rarely accidental. They’re structured—starting broad, narrowing fast, verifying data availability, and aligning the “topic” to policy and evidence.

Key takeaways:
- **Decompose the site** using relevance trees to identify controlling constraints early.  
- **Filter opportunities** using the six-aspect screen (especially policy relevance and data availability).  
- **Gate decisions** with structured option matrices to stop DA scope creep and protect timelines.

If you want your next project to move faster with fewer surprises, the work starts before concept design—it starts at selection and feasibility.
