## This is a Test Draft Post

This is a **test draft post** created to verify the draft admin system is working correctly.

### Key Points

- The draft admin login is functional
- Draft posts are created via GitHub PRs
- Content can be previewed before publishing
- Publishing merges the PR to main

### Next Steps

Once verified, this draft can be deleted. The draft admin system allows you to:

1. Preview draft content before it goes live
2. Edit content directly in the browser
3. Publish with a single click (squash-merges the PR)
