## What You Get With a Client-Side PM

Most developers hire the contractor's PM. That's like hiring the other side's lawyer.

### Catch Issues Before They Cost You

Our architectural background means we see problems in drawings that most PMs miss. We catch coordination issues, buildability problems, and compliance gaps before they become expensive site variations.

### Someone in Your Corner

We represent you, not the contractor. Every progress claim reviewed, every variation challenged, every decision made with your investment protected.

### One Team, Start to Finish

From feasibility and DA through tender, construction, and handover. No handoffs, no lost context, no starting over with someone new.

## Our Services

Comprehensive client-side project management, from early feasibility through construction delivery.
